O Divine Providence!  Immerse the father and mother of this servant of Thy Threshold in the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and purge and sanctify them from every sin and transgression.  Grant them Thy forgiveness and mercy, and bestow upon them Thy gracious pardon.  Thou, verily, art the Pardoner, the Ever-Forgiving, the Bestower of abundant grace.  O Thou forgiving Lord!  Though we are sinners, yet our hopes are fixed upon Thy promise and assurance.  Though we are enveloped by the darkness of error, yet we have at all times turned our faces to the morn of Thy bountiful favours.  Deal with us as beseemeth Thy Threshold, and confer upon us that which is worthy of Thy Court.  Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner, He Who overlooketh every shortcoming.
