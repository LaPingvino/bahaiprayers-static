O Divine Providence!  Lift to Thy lovers' lips a cup brimful of anguish.  To the yearners on Thy pathway, make sweetness but a sting, and poison honey-sweet.  Set Thou our heads for ornaments on the points of spears.  Make Thou our hearts the targets for pitiless arrows and darts.  Raise Thou this withered soul to life on the martyr's field, make Thou his faded heart to drink the draft of tyranny, and thus grow fresh and fair once more.  Make him to be drunk with the wine of Thine Eternal Covenant, make him a reveler holding high his cup.  Help him to fling away his life; grant that for Thy sake, he be offered up.

Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.  Thou art the Knower, the Seer, the Hearer.
