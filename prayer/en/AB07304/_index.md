O Thou forgiving Lord!
Although some souls have spent the days of their lives in ignorance, and became estranged and contumacious, yet, with one wave from the ocean of Thy forgiveness, all those encompassed by sin will be set free.  Whomsoever Thou willest Thou makest a confidant, and whosoever is not the object of Thy choice is accounted a transgressor.  Shouldst Thou deal with us with Thy justice, we are all naught but sinners and deserving to be shut out from Thee, but shouldst Thou uphold mercy, every sinner would be made pure and every stranger a friend.  Bestow, then, Thy forgiveness and pardon, and grant Thy mercy unto all.
Thou art the Forgiver, the Lightgiver and the Omnipotent.

-- Abdu'l-Bah√°
