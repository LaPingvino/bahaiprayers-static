*Prayer to be said at the close of the meeting of the Spiritual Assembly.



O God!  O God!  From the unseen kingdom of Thy oneness behold us assembled in this spiritual meeting, believing in Thee, confident in Thy signs, firm in Thy Covenant and Testament, attracted to Thee, set aglow with the fire of Thy love and sincere in Thy Cause.  We are servants in Thy vineyard, spreaders of Thy religion, devoted worshipers of Thy countenance, humble towards Thy loved ones, submissive before Thy door, and imploring Thee to confirm us in serving Thy chosen ones, to support us with Thine unseen hosts, to strengthen our loins in Thy servitude and to make us submissive and adoring subjects communing with Thee.
O our Lord!  We are weak, and Thou art the Mighty, the Powerful.  We are lifeless, and Thou art the great life-giving Spirit.  We are needy, and Thou art the Sustainer, the Powerful.
O our Lord!  Turn our faces unto Thy merciful countenance, feed us from Thy heavenly table with Thine abundant grace, assist us with the hosts of Thy supreme angels and confirm us through the holy ones of the Kingdom of Abhá.
Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Merciful.  Thou art the Possessor of great bounty, and, verily, Thou art the Clement and the Gracious.
