O Thou Omnipotent Lord!  We are all held within the mighty grasp of Thy power.  Thou art our Supporter and our Helper.  Grant us Thy tender mercy, bestow upon us Thy bounty, open the portals of grace, and cast upon us the glance of Thy favours.  Let a vivifying breeze waft over us, and quicken Thou our yearning hearts.  Illumine our eyes and make the sanctuary of our hearts the envy of every blossoming bower.  Rejoice every soul and gladden every spirit.  Reveal Thine ancient power and make manifest Thy great might.  Cause the birds of human souls to soar to new heights, and let Thy confidants in this nether world fathom the mysteries of Thy Kingdom.  Set firm our steps and bestow upon us unwavering hearts.  We are sinners, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving.  We are Thy servants, and Thou art the Sovereign Lord.  We are homeless wanderers, and Thou art our haven and refuge.  Graciously aid and assist us to diffuse Thy sweet savours and to exalt Thy Word.  Elevate the station of the dispossessed, and bestow Thine inexhaustible treasure upon the destitute.  Vouchsafe Thy strength unto the weak, and confer heavenly power upon the feeble.  Thou art the Provider, Thou art the Gracious, Thou art the Lord Who ruleth over all things.
