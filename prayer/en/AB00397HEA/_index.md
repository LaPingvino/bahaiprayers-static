O Thou loving Provider!  These souls have hearkened to the summons of the Kingdom, and have gazed upon the glory of the Sun of Truth.  They have risen upward to the refreshing skies of love; they are enamored of Thy nature, and they worship Thy beauty.  Unto Thee have they turned themselves, speaking together of Thee, seeking out Thy dwelling, and thirsting for the waterbrooks of Thy heavenly realm.
Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Ever-Loving.
