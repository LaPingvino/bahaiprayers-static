O my God!  O my God!  I testify that this is Thy Day which hath been mentioned in Thy Books, Thy Epistles, Thy Psalms and Thy Tablets.  In it Thou hast manifested that which was hidden in Thy Knowledge and stored up in the repositories of Thine unfailing protection.  I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world, by Thy Most Great Name whereby the limbs of the people were shaken, to assist Thy servants and Thy handmaidens to become steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise in Thy service. 
Verily, Thou art potent to do whatsoever Thou willest, and in Thy grasp are the reins of all things.  Thou protectest whomsoever Thou willest through Thy Power and Dominion.  And verily, Thou art the Almighty, the All-Subduing, the Most Powerful.
