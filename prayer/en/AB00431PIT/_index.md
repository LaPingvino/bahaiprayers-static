Lord!  Pitiful are we, grant us Thy favor; poor, bestow upon us a share from the ocean of Thy wealth;needy, do Thou satisfy us; abased, give us Thy glory.  The fowls of the air and the beasts of the field receive their meat each day from Thee and all beings partake of Thy care and loving kindness.
Deprive not this feeble one of Thy wondrous grace and vouchsafe by Thy might unto this helpless soul Thy bounty.
Give us our daily bread and grant Thine increase in the necessities of life, that we may be dependent on none other than Thee, may commune wholly with Thee, may walk in Thy ways and declare Thy mysteries. Thou art the Almighty and the Loving and the Provider of all mankind.
