O God of Mercy!  O Thou Omnipotent One!  I am but a feeble servant, weak and helpless, but I have been nurtured within the shelter of Thy grace and favour, nourished from the breast of Thy mercy, and reared in the bosom of Thy loving-kindness.  O Lord!  Poor and needy though I be, yet every needy one is made prosperous through Thy bounty, while every wealthy one, if bereft of Thy favours, is indeed poor and desolate.

O Divine Providence!  Grant me the strength to bear this heavy burden, and enable me to safeguard this supreme bestowal, for so strong is the force of tests and so grievous the onslaught of trials that every mountain is scattered in dust, and the highest peak reduced to nothing.  Thou knowest full well that in my heart I seek naught but Thy remembrance, and in my soul I desire nothing save Thy love.  Raise me up to serve Thy loved ones, and let me abide forever in servitude at Thy Threshold.  Thou art the Loving.  Thou art the Lord of manifold bounties.
