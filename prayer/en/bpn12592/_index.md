He is God.

O Thou forgiving Lord!  These servants were noble souls, and these radiant hearts were made illumined and resplendent through the light of Thy guidance.  They drank a brimming cup of the wine of Thy love, and gave ear to eternal mysteries by the melodies of Thy knowledge.  They bound their hearts to Thee, broke free from the snare of estrangement, and laid hold of Thy unity.  Make these precious souls companions of the inmates of Heaven, and admit them into the circle of Thy chosen ones.  Make them intimates of Thy mysteries in the retreats of the realm above, and immerse them in the sea of lights.  Thou art the Bestower, the Luminous, and the Kind.
