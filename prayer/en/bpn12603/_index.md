O Thou incomparable God!  We are Thy humble servants, and Thou art the All-Glorious.  We are sinners, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving.  We are captives, poor and lowly, and Thou art our shelter and our aid.  We are as tiny ants, and Thou art the Lord of majesty, enthroned in the highest heaven.  Protect us, as a token of Thy grace, and withhold not from us Thy care and assistance.  O Lord!  Thy tests are indeed severe, and Thy trials can lay in ruin foundations wrought of steel.  Preserve and strengthen us; cheer and gladden our hearts.  Graciously assist us to serve, even as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Thy sacred Threshold.

-- Abdu'l-Bahá
