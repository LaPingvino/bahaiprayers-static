O Thou kind God! 
 
From America, that distant country, we hastened to the Holy Land and directed our steps toward this blessed Spot. We attained unto the two blessed and sacred Thresholds and obtained boundless grace therefrom.  We have now come to Mount Carmel, which is Thy sacred garden.  Most of the Prophets turned to Thee in prayer upon this holy mountain, communing with Thee in the utmost humility at the midnight hour. 
O Lord! We are now in this blessed place. We beseech Thine infinite bounties and long for a joyous and tranquil conscience.  We desire firmness in the Covenant and seek Thy good-pleasure to our last breath.  
O Lord! Forgive our sins and bestow upon us Thy manifold favours.  Shield us within the shelter of Thy protection.  Guard and preserve these two little children and nurture them in the embrace of Thy Love. 
Thou art the Forgiver, the Resplendent, the Ever-Loving.
