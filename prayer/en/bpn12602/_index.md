O Divine Providence, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving!  O Thou Almighty God, Thou art the Gracious!  Let this dearly loved servant of Thine abide beneath the shadow of Thy glory, and grant that this hapless and lowly one may prosper and flourish within the precincts of Thy mercy.  Give him to drink from the chalice of Thy nearness, and let him abide under the shade of the Blessed Tree.  Confer upon him the honour of attaining Thy presence, and bestow upon him everlasting bliss.  Graciously assist the surviving kindred of this noble soul to follow in the footsteps of their dear father, to show forth his character and conduct amongst all people, to follow Thy path, seek Thy good-pleasure, and utter Thy praise.  Thou art the Ever-Loving God, the Lord of bounty.
