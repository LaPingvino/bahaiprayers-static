Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God!  I beseech Thee by Him Who is Thy Most Great Name, Who hath been sorely afflicted by such of Thy creatures as have repudiated Thy truth, and Who hath been hemmed in by sorrows which no tongue can describe, to grant that I may remember Thee and celebrate Thy praise, in these days when all have turned away from Thy beauty, have disputed with Thee, and turned away disdainfully from Him Who is the Revealer of Thy Cause.  None is there, O my Lord, to help Thee except Thine own Self, and no power to succor Thee save Thine own power.
I entreat Thee to enable me to cleave steadfastly to Thy love and Thy remembrance.  This is, verily, within my power, and Thou art the One that knoweth all that is in me.  Thou, in truth, art knowing, apprised of all.  Deprive me not, O my Lord, of the splendors of the light of Thy face,whose brightness hath illuminated the whole world.  No God is there beside Thee, the Most Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
