O my God! O my God! I am a servant attracted to Thee, humbly drawing near to the door of Thy Oneness and supplicating the Kingdom of Thy mercy.

O my God, permit me to be entirely Thine, occupied only with thoughts of Thee, inflamed by the fire of Thy love and separated from all except Thee, so that I may work in Thy Cause, spread Thy wisdom, transmit Thy knowledge and impart the joy of knowing Thee.

O my God, I am a flame lighted by the hands of Thy power; let not that flame be quenched by the winds of trials. Increase my love for Thee, my ardor for the Beauty of Thy Oneness. Kindle the fire that burns in me in the Sinai of Thy Singleness, and the eternal life that is latent in me, through Thy bounty and grace. 

Thou art the Protector, the Watcher, the Compassionate and the Merciful!
