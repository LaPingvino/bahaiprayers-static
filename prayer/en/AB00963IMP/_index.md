#Mother Temple of the West
O God, my God!  I implore Thee with a throbbing heart and streaming tears to aid whosoever expendeth his energy for the erection of this House, and the construction of this Building wherein Thy name is mentioned every morn and every eve.

O God!  Send down Thy divine increase on whosoever endeavoreth to serve this edifice and exerteth himself to raise it amongst the kindreds and religions of the world.  Confirm him in every good deed in promoting the welfare of mankind.  Open Thou the doors of wealth and abundance unto him and make him an heir to the treasures of the Kingdom, which perish not.  Make him a sign of Thy bestowals among the peoples and reinforce him by the sea of Thy generosity and bounty, surging with waves of Thy grace and favor.  Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Merciful and the Bountiful.
