In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Exalted, the Most Glorious! 
 
Glory be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all beings and the Ultimate Aim of all creation!  I testify with the tongue of both mine inner and outer being that Thou hast revealed and manifested Thyself, that Thou hast sent down Thy verses and demonstrated Thy proofs, and that Thou art independent of anyone besides Thee and sanctified above all else except Thyself.  I ask Thee, by the glory of Thy Cause and the power of Thy Word, graciously to assist them that have arisen to discharge what hath been enjoined upon them in Thy Book, and to perform that whereby the fragrance of Thine acceptance may be shed abroad.  Thou, verily, art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Forgiving, the Bountiful.
