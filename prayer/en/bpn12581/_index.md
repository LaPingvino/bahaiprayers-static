He is God.

O thou who circlest in adoration about the Spot round which circle the Concourse on high!  Raise thou thy hands in gratitude at the Threshold of the one true God, and say:  O Thou the highest aspiration of every ardent lover!  O Thou the Guide of every wandering soul!  Thou hast favoured this feeble servant with Thine infinite blessings, and led this hapless and lowly one unto the Threshold of Thy oneness.  Thou hast lifted to these parched lips the living waters of Thy loving-kindness and revived this weary and withered soul with the breezes of divine mercy.  I yield Thee thanks for having bestowed upon me a full portion from Thy most gracious favour and invested me with the honour of attaining unto Thy sacred Threshold.  I beseech an infinite share from the bounties of Thy Kingdom on high.  Grant Thine assistance.  Confer Thy gracious favour.
