O Thou peerless and loving Lord!  Though capacity and worthiness are lacking, and it is infinitely hard to withstand tribulations, yet worthiness and capacity are gifts vouchsafed by Thee.  O Lord!  Give us capacity and make us worthy, that we may evince the most great steadfastness, renounce this world and all its people, kindle the fire of Thy love, and even as candles, burn bright with a consuming flame and shed abroad our radiance.

O Lord of the Kingdom!  Deliver us from this world of vain illusions, and lead us unto the realm of the infinite.  Suffer us to be wholly freed from this nether life, and cause us to be blessed with the bountiful gifts of the Kingdom.  Release us from this world of nothingness that beareth the semblance of reality, and confer upon us life everlasting.  Bestow on us joy and delight, and favour us with gladness and contentment.  Comfort our hearts, and grant peace and tranquillity to our souls, so that upon ascending unto Thy Kingdom we may attain Thy presence and may rejoice in the realms above.  Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Almighty!
