Glory be unto Thee, O my God!  Verily, this thy servant and this Thy maidservant have gathered under the shadow of Thy mercy and they are united through Thy favor and generosity.  O Lord!  Assist them in this Thy world and Thy kingdom and destine for them every good through Thy bounty and grace.  O Lord!  Confirm them in Thy servitude and assist them in Thy service.  Suffer them to become the signs of Thy Name in Thy world and protect them through Thy bestowals which are inexhaustible in this world and the world to come.  O Lord!  They are supplicating the kingdom of Thy mercifulness and invoking the realm of Thy singleness.  Verily, they are married in obedience to Thy command. Cause them to become the signs of harmony and unity until the end of time.  Verily, Thou art the Omnipotent, the Omnipresent and the Almighty!
