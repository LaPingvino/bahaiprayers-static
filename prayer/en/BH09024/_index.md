Many a chilled heart, O my God, hath been set ablaze by the fire of Thy Cause, and many a slumberer hath been wakened by the sweetness of Thy voice.  How many are the strangers who have sought shelter beneath the shadow of the tree of Thy oneness, and how numerous the thirsty ones who have panted after the fountain of Thy living waters in Thy days!
Blessed is he that hath set himself towards Thee, and hasted to attain the Dayspring of the lights of Thy face.  Blessed is he who with all his affections hath turned to the Dawning-Place of Thy Revelation and the Fountainhead of Thine inspiration.  Blessed is he that hath expended in Thy path what Thou didst bestow upon him through Thy bounty and favor.  Blessed is he who, in his sore longing after Thee, hath cast away all else except Thyself.  Blessed is he who hath enjoyed intimate communion with Thee, and rid himself of all attachment to anyone save Thee.
I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by Him Who is Thy Name, Who, through the power of Thy sovereignty and might, hath risen above the horizon of His prison, to ordain for everyone what becometh Thee and beseemeth Thine exaltation.
Thy might, in truth, is equal to all things.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
