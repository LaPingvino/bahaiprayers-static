O Thou beloved of my heart and soul!  I have no refuge save Thee.  I raise no voice at dawn save in Thy commemoration and praise.  Thy love encompasseth me and Thy grace is perfect.  
My hope is in Thee. 
O God, give me a new life at every instant and bestow upon me the breaths of the Holy Spirit at every moment, in order that I may remain steadfast in Thy love, attain unto great felicity, perceive the manifest light and be in the state of utmost tranquillity and submissiveness. 
Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Forgiver, the Compassionate.
