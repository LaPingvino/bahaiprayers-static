He is God.

O Thou kind and beloved Lord!  These friends are exhilarated with the wine of the Covenant and are wanderers in the wilderness of Thy love.  Their hearts are consumed by the flames of remoteness from Thee, and they yearn eagerly for the revelation of Thy splendours.  From Thine invisible Kingdom, the Realm of the unseen, reveal unto them the effulgent glory of Thy grace, and shed upon them the radiance of Thy bounty.  At every moment, send forth a new blessing and reveal a fresh favour.

O Divine Providence!  We are weak and Thou art the Most Powerful.  We are as tiny ants and Thou art the King of the Realm of Glory.  Bestow Thy grace and confer Thy bounty upon us, that we may kindle a flame and shed its splendour abroad, that we may show forth strength and render some service.  Grant that we may bring illumination to this darksome earth and spirituality to this fleeting world of dust.  Suffer us not to rest for a moment, nor to defile ourselves with the transitory things of this life.  Enable us to prepare a banquet of guidance, inscribe with our life-blood the verses of love, leave fear and peril behind, become even as fruitful trees, and cause human perfections to appear in this ephemeral world.  Thou, in truth, art the All-Bountiful, the Most Compassionate, the Ever-Forgiving, the Pardoner.
