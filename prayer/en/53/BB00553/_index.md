Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God!  Thou art in truth the Knower of things unseen.  Ordain for us such good as Thine all-embracing knowledge can measure.  Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved. 
All praise be unto Thee, O Lord!  We shall seek Thy grace on the appointed Day and shall put our whole reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord.  Glorified art Thou, O God!  Grant us that which is good and seemly that we may be able to dispense with everything but Thee.  Verily, Thou art the Lord of all worlds. 

O God!  Recompense those who endure patiently in Thy days, and strengthen their hearts to walk undeviatingly in the path of Truth.  Grant then, O Lord, such goodly gifts as would enable them to gain admittance into Thy blissful Paradise.  Exalted art Thou, O Lord God.  Let Thy heavenly blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have believed in Thee.  Verily, unsurpassed art Thou in sending down divine blessings.  Send forth, O God, such hosts as would render Thy faithful servants victorious.  Thou dost fashion the created things through the power of Thy decree as Thou pleasest.  Thou art in truth the Sovereign, the Creator, the All-Wise. 

Say: God is indeed the Maker of all things.  He giveth sustenance in plenty to whomsoever He willeth.  He is the Creator, the Source of all beings, the Fashioner, the Almighty, the Maker, the All-Wise.  He is the Bearer of the most excellent titles throughout the heavens and the earth and whatever lieth between them.  All do His bidding, and all the dwellers of earth and heaven celebrate His praise, and unto Him shall all return.
