O God our Lord!  Protect us through Thy grace from whatsoever may be repugnant unto Thee, and vouchsafe unto us that which well beseemeth Thee.  Give us more out of Thy bounty, and bless us.  Pardon us for the things we have done, and wash away our sins, and forgive us with Thy gracious forgiveness.  Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting.
Thy loving providence hath encompassed all created things in the heavens and on the earth, and Thy forgiveness hath surpassed the whole creation.  Thine is sovereignty; in Thy hand are the Kingdoms of Creation and Revelation; in Thy right hand Thou holdest all created things, and within Thy grasp are the assigned measures of forgiveness. Thou forgivest whomsoever among Thy servants Thou pleasest.  Verily, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving.  Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge, and naught is there which is hidden from Thee.
O God our Lord!  Protect us through the potency of Thy might, enable us to enter Thy wondrous surging ocean, and grant us that which well befitteth Thee.
Thou art the Sovereign Ruler, the Mighty Doer, the Exalted, the All-Loving.
