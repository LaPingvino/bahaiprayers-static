O Thou kind Lord! 
 
Grant that these trees may become the adornment of the Abhá Paradise.  Cause them to grow through Thy celestial bounty.  Make them fresh and verdant and besprinkle them with heavenly dewdrops.  Attire them with robes of radiant beauty and crown their heads with gorgeous blossoms.  Adorn them with goodly fruit and waft over them Thy sweet savours. 
Thou art the Bestower, the All-Loving, the Most Radiant, the Most Resplendent.

-- Abdu'l-Bahá
