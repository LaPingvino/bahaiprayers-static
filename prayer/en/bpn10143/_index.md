O thou little handmaid of God!
I earnestly hope that thou wilt be nurtured in the bosom of the love of God and wilt grow and develop through the vitalizing breeze which wafteth from the meads of the Kingdom of heaven, that thou mayest become a flourishing tree beside the stream of divine knowledge, laden with fruit and blossoms and appear in the utmost freshness and tender beauty through the sprinkling of the clouds of His bounty. Be assured that the eye of His loving-kindness is directed towards thee and the glance of His mercifulness resteth upon thee.
