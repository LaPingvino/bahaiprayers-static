O my kind Lord, O Thou the desire of my heart and soul!  Bestow upon Thy friends Thy loving-kindness, and grant them Thine unfailing mercy.  Be Thou a solace to Thine ardent lovers, and a friend, a comforter, and a loving companion to them who yearn for Thee.  Their hearts are ablaze with the fire of Thy love, and their souls are consumed with the flame of devotion to Thee.  They long, one and all, to hasten unto the altar of love, that they may willingly lay down their lives.

O Divine Providence!  Grant them Thy favour, guide them aright, graciously aid them to achieve spiritual victory, and confer upon them heavenly bestowals.  O Lord, assist them by Thy munificence and grace, and make their radiant faces lamps of guidance in assemblies devoted to the knowledge of Thee, and signs of heavenly bounty in gatherings where Thy verses are expounded.  Thou art, verily, the Merciful, the All-Bountiful, the One Whose help is implored by all men.
