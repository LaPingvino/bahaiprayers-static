O thou verdant plant of the Abh치 Paradise! O thou tender sapling of the rose-garden of immortality!
Although thou art but a tiny creature in this world of existence, yet it is my earnest hope that thou wilt become great in the Kingdom of heaven. Although a mere child, yet praise be to God that through the strengthening power of faith and certitude thou art indeed as a grown-up and mature soul.
Know thou of a certainty that those of tender age in the Abh치 Garden shall inherit the realm of the Kingdom and that the outpourings of celestial grace encompass the children in the school of the love of God. It is my hope that through the manifold bounties of Him Who is the Lord of Oneness thou mayest be reared and nurtured beside this heavenly stream which floweth in the rose-garden of divine guidance.
Upon thee be the glory of the Most Glorious.
