He is God.

O God, my God!  I have set my face towards Thee, and supplicate the outpourings of the ocean of Thy healing.  Graciously assist me, O Lord, to serve Thy people and to heal Thy servants.  If Thou dost aid me, the remedy I offer will become a healing medicine for every ailment, a draught of life-giving waters for every burning thirst, and a soothing balm for every yearning heart.  If Thou dost not aid me, it will be naught but affliction itself, and I will scarcely bring healing to any soul.

O God, my God!  Aid and assist me through Thy power to heal the sick.  Thou art, verily, the Healer, the Sufficer, He Who is the remover of every pain and sickness, He Who hath dominion over all things.

-- Abdu'l-Bah√°
