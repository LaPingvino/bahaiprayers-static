Bless Thou, O King of Kings, the city of New York!  Cause the friends there to be kind to one another.  Purify their souls and make their hearts to be free and detached.  Illumine the world of their consciousness.  Exhilarate their spirits and bestow celestial power and confirmation upon them.  Establish there a heavenly realm, so that the City of Baha may prosper and New York be favoured with blessings from the Abha Kingdom, that this region may become like the all-highest Paradise, may develop into a vineyard of God and be transformed into a heavenly orchard and a spiritual rose garden.
