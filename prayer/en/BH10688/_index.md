O God, my God!  I have set out from my home, holding fast unto the cord of Thy love, and I have committed myself wholly to Thy care and Thy protection.  I entreat Thee by Thy power through which Thou didst protect Thy loved ones from the wayward and the perverse, and from every contumacious oppressor, and every wicked doer who hath strayed far from Thee, to keep me safe by Thy bounty and Thy grace.  Enable me, then, to return to my home by Thy power and Thy might.  Thou art, truly, the Almighty, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
