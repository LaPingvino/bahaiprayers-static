O Thou forgiving Lord!  Thou art the shelter of all these Thy servants.  Thou knowest the secrets and art aware of all things.  We are all helpless, and Thou art the Mighty, the Omnipotent.  We are all sinners, and Thou art the Forgiver of sins, the Merciful, the Compassionate.  O Lord!  Look not at our shortcomings.  Deal with us according to Thy grace and bounty.  Our shortcomings are many, but the ocean of Thy forgiveness is boundless.  Our weakness is grievous, but the evidences of Thine aid and assistance are clear.  Therefore, confirm and strengthen us.  Enable us to do that which is worthy of Thy holy Threshold.  Illumine our hearts, grant us discerning eyes and attentive ears.  Resuscitate the dead and heal the sick.  Bestow wealth upon the poor and give peace and security to the fearful. Accept us in Thy kingdom and illumine us with the light of guidance. Thou art the Powerful and the Omnipotent.  Thou art the Generous. Thou art the Clement.  Thou art the Kind.
