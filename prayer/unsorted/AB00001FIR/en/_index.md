O Lord my God!  Assist Thy loved ones to be firm in Thy Faith, to walk in Thy ways, to be steadfast in Thy Cause.  Give them Thy grace to withstand the onslaught of self and passion, to follow the light of divine guidance.  Thou art the Powerful, the Gracious, the Self-Subsisting, the Bestower, the Compassionate, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.
