**Remover of Difficulties

God-im avataagun nagliksaaġutit piiqsiqaqpat? 
Uqallagiñ: Nanġaqtauli God! Ilaa God-tauruq! 
Iluqaġmik kivgagġigaich kamagivlugu sutqupayaaġmatik.

Is there any Remover of difficulties save God? Say: Praised be God! He is God! All are His servants, and all abide by His bidding!
