O my God!  O my God!  Unite the hearts of Thy servants, and reveal to them Thy great purpose.  May they follow Thy commandments and abide in Thy law.  Help them, O God, in their endeavor, and grant them strength to serve Thee.  O God!  Leave them not to themselves, but guide their steps by the light of Thy knowledge, and cheer their hearts by Thy love.  Verily, Thou art their Helper and their Lord.

##Note:
*‘Although no original text has been found for the prayer that begins “O my God!  O my God!  Unite the hearts of Thy servants”, it was included in J. E. Esslemont’s “Baha’u’llah and the New Era”, which was written during the lifetime of ‘Abdu’l-Baha....  The Research Department has indicated that further research is required before a conclusion regarding the authenticity of this prayer can be reached.  In the meantime, the use of this prayer may continue as before.’”
