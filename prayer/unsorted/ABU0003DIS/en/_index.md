##The Nineteen Day Feast


O God!  Dispel all those elements which are the cause of discord, and prepare for us all those things which are the cause of unity and accord!  O God!  Descend upon us Heavenly Fragrance and change this gathering into a gathering of Heaven!  Grant to us every benefit and every food.  Prepare for us the Food of Love!  Give us the Food of Knowledge!  Bestow on us the Food of Heavenly Illumination!
