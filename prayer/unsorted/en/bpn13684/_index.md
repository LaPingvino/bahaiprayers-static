O Thou compassionate Lord! O Lord of Hosts! Praise be unto Thee that Thou hast preferred these young children over the full grown and the matured, hast endowed them with Thy special bounty, hast guided them, hast bestowed upon them Thy Light and hast given them spirituality. Confirm us so that when we attain maturity we may be enabled to serve Thy Kingdom, may train the souls, may become ignited candles and may shine like unto stars. Thou art the Giver, the Bestower and the Kind.
