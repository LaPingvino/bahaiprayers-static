O Divine Providence!  Perplexing difficulties have arisen and formidable obstacles have appeared.  O Lord!  Remove these difficulties and show forth the evidences of Thy might and power.  Ease these hardships and smooth our way along this arduous path.  O Divine Providence!  The obstacles are unyielding, and our toil and hardship are conjoined with a myriad adversities.  There is no helper save Thee, and no succourer except Thyself.  We set all our hopes on Thee, and commit all our affairs unto Thy care.  Thou art the Guide and the Remover of every difficulty, and Thou art the Wise, the Seeing, and the Hearing.
