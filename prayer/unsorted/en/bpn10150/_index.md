O ye candles which have been lighted by the fingers of the Blessed Perfection!
Praise be to God that ye are illumined by the light of knowledge and are earnestly striving to acquire noble virtues. At the threshold of the Abh치 Beauty ye are regarded with favour and in the school of education ye are suckling babes at the breast of arts and sciences. I beseech God that ye may be so highly distinguished in sciences that your fame will be noised throughout all regions and your fair name be on the lips of all enlightened people; that ye may become the means of the exaltation of the Cause of God and the exponents of the manifold blessings of the Abh치 Beauty.
May the glory of the Most Glorious rest upon you!
