O Thou forgiving God!  Forgive the sins of my loving mother, pardon her shortcomings, cast upon her the glance of Thy gracious providence, and enable her to gain admittance into Thy Kingdom. 
O God!  From the earliest days of my life she educated and nurtured me, yet I did not recompense her for her toil and labours.  Do Thou reward her by granting her eternal life and making her exalted in Thy Kingdom.  
Verily, Thou art the Forgiver, the Bestower, and the Kind.
