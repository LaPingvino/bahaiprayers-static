O Compassionate God!  O Lord of Hosts!  Praise be unto Thee that Thou hast preferred these little children over the full-grown and mature, and bestowed upon them Thy special favours.  Thou hast guided them.  Thou hast been kind to them.  Thou hast conferred upon them illumination and spirituality.  Grant us Thy confirmation so that, when we grow up, we may engage in service to Thy Kingdom, become the cause of educating others, burn like radiant candles and shine like brilliant stars.  Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Compassionate.
