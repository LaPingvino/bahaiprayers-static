O God, my God!  Give me to drink from the cup of Thy bestowal and illumine my face with the light of guidance.  Make me firm in the path of faithfulness, assist me to be steadfast in Thy mighty Covenant, and suffer me to be numbered with Thy chosen servants.  Unlock before my face the doors of abundance, grant me deliverance, and sustain me, through means I cannot reckon, from the treasuries of heaven.  Suffer me to turn my face toward the countenance of Thy generosity and to be entirely devoted to Thee, O Thou Who art merciful and compassionate!  To those that stand fast and firm in Thy Covenant Thou, verily, art gracious and generous.  All praise be to God, the Lord of the worlds!
