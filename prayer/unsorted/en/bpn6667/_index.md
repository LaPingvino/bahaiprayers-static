O God, my God! Thy grace hath emboldened me, and Thy justice filled me with terror. Happy is that man whom Thou hast endued with Thy grace and woe to him that receiveth Thy justice.

Lord! I have fled from Thy justice, and have sought Thy grace, have turned from Thy wrath and implored Thy pardon. I beseech Thee, by Thy power, Thy sovereignty, Thy glory and Thy favour to illumine mankind with the light of Thy knowledge, that all things may show Thy handiwork, may unfold the mysteries of Thy power, and may reveal the light of Thy knowledge.

Thou art the One that hath caused all things to be made manifest and hath shone upon them with the light of Thy care and Thy providence.
