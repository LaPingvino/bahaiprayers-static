He is the All-Glorious.

O my Lord, my King, my Ruler, and my Sovereign!  I call upon Thee with my tongue, my heart, and my soul, saying:  Clothe this servant of Thine with the robe of Thy care, the raiment of Thine unfailing help, and the armour of Thy protection.  Assist him to make mention of Thee and to extol Thy virtues amidst Thy people, and unloose his tongue to utter Thy glorification and praise in every assemblage held to celebrate Thy unity and sanctity.  Thou art, in truth, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Glorious, the Self-Subsisting.
