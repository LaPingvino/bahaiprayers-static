Glory be unto Thee, O God.  How can I make mention of Thee while Thou art sanctified from the praise of all mankind.  Magnified be Thy Name, O God, Thou art the King, the Eternal Truth; Thou knowest what is in the heavens and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return.  Thou hast sent down Thy divinely ordained Revelation according to a clear measure.  Praised art Thou, O Lord!  At Thy behest Thou dost render victorious whomsoever Thou willest, through the hosts of heaven and earth and whatsoever existeth between them.  Thou art the Sovereign, the Eternal Truth, the Lord of invincible might.
Glorified art Thou, O Lord!  Thou forgivest at all times the sins of such among Thy servants as implore Thy pardon.  Wash away my sins and the sins of those who seek Thy forgiveness at dawn, who pray to Thee in the daytime and in the night season, who yearn after naught save God, who offer up whatsoever God hath graciously bestowed upon them, who celebrate Thy praise at morn and eventide, and who are not remiss in their duties.
