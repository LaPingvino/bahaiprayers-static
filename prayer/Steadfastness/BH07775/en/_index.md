O God, my God!  I have turned in repentance unto Thee, and verily Thou art the Pardoner, the Compassionate.
O God, my God!  I have returned to Thee, and verily Thou art the the Ever-Forgiving, the Gracious.
O God, my God!  I have clung to the cord of Thy bounty, and with Thee is the storehouse of all that is in heaven and earth.
O God, my God!  I have hastened toward Thee, and verily Thou art the Forgiver, the Lord of grace abounding.
O God, my God!  I thirst for the celestial wine of Thy grace, and verily Thou art the Giver, the Bountiful, the Gracious, the Almighty.
O God, my God!  I testify that Thou hast revealed Thy Cause, fulfilled Thy promise and sent down from the heaven of Thy grace that which hath drawn unto Thee the hearts of Thy favored ones.  Well is it with him that hath held fast unto Thy firm cord and clung to the hem of Thy resplendent robe!
I ask Thee, O Lord of all being and King of the seen and unseen, by Thy power, Thy majesty and Thy sovereignty, to grant that my name may be recorded by Thy pen of glory among Thy devoted ones, them whom the scrolls of the sinful hindered not from turning to the light of Thy countenance, O prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God!
