#Midnight


*O seeker of Truth!  If thou desirest that God may open thine eye, thou must supplicate unto God, pray to and commune with Him at midnight, saying:



O Lord, I have turned my face unto Thy kingdom of oneness and am immersed in the sea of Thy mercy.  O Lord, enlighten my sight by beholding Thy lights in this dark night, and make me happy by the wine of Thy love in this wonderful age.  O Lord, make me hear Thy call, and open before my face the doors of Thy heaven, so that I may see the light of Thy glory and become attracted to Thy beauty.
Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Generous, the Merciful, the Forgiving.
