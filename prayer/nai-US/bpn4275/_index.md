Waayantanin bluha
Wakantanka mitawa
Sloci in kta un makakaga
Na ci yu onihan te
Le oape ki el
Omahiti ke sni
Na niye onihitike
Wamahpa nica
Na Niye winisica
Nisnala wakan ni tanka
Wokokipe el wayokiya
Na iye oiciya


*I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth.
There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
