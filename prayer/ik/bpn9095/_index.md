Kaŋiqsigiga qaunakkutin, God-iiŋ, Ikayuqtausuumaruq paqitchiruaq qaunakkunmik Iliŋni tutqiksimaaġnamallu suaŋammallu.

I have wakened in Thy shelter, O my God, and it becometh him that seeketh that shelter to abide within the Sanctuary of Thy protection and the Stronghold of Thy defense.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
