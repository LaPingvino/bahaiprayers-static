O Lord!  Thou art the Remover of every anguish and the Dispeller of every affliction.  Thou art He Who banisheth every sorrow and setteth free every slave, the Redeemer of every soul.  O Lord!  Grant deliverance through Thy mercy, and reckon me among such servants of Thine as have gained salvation.
