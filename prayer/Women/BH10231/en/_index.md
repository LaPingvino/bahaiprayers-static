Thou seest, O my God, how the wrongs committed by such of Thy creatures as have turned their backs to Thee have come in between Him in Whom Thy Godhead is manifest and Thy servants.  Send down upon them, O my Lord, what will cause them to be busied with each others' concerns.  Let, then, their violence be confined to their own selves, that the land and they that dwell therein may find peace.
One of Thy handmaidens, O my Lord, hath sought Thy face, and soared in the atmosphere of Thy pleasure.  Withhold not from her, O my Lord, the things Thou didst ordain for the chosen ones among Thy handmaidens.
Enable her, then, to be so attracted by Thine utterances that she will celebrate Thy praise amongst them.

Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  No God is there but Thee, the Almighty, Whose help is implored by all men.
