In the Name of Him Who hath been promised in the Books of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed!  The days of fasting have arrived wherein those servants who circle round Thy throne and have attained Thy presence have fasted.  Say: O God of names and creator of heaven and earth!  I beg of Thee by Thy Name, the All-Glorious, to accept the fast of those who have fasted for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy good-pleasure and have carried out what Thou hast bidden them in Thy Books and Tablets.  I beseech Thee by them to assist me in the promotion of Thy Cause and to make me steadfast in Thy love, that my footsteps may not slip on account of the clamor of Thy creatures. Verily, Thou art powerful over whatsoever Thou willest.  No God is there but Thee, the Quickener, the All-Powerful, the Most Bountiful, the Ancient of Days.
