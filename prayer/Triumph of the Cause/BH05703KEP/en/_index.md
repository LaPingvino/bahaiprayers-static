Suffer me not, O God, my God, to be kept back from the heaven of Thy bounties and the daystar of Thy favors.  I beseech Thee by that Word through which Thou hast subdued all things visible and invisible to assist me and to assist Thy chosen ones to accomplish that which shall exalt Thy Cause amidst Thy servants and throughout Thy regions.  Do Thou ordain for me, then, every good thing which Thou hast sent down in Thy Book.
Verily Thou art the Almighty, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.
