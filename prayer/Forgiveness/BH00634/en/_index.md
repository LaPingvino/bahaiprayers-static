Praise be unto Thee, O Lord.  Forgive us our sins, have mercy upon us and enable us to return unto Thee.  Suffer us not to rely on aught else besides Thee, and vouchsafe unto us, through Thy bounty, that which Thou lovest and desirest and well beseemeth Thee.  Exalt the station of them that have truly believed, and forgive them with Thy gracious forgiveness.  Verily, Thou art the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
