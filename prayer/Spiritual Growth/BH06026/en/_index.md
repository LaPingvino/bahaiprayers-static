He is the Gracious, the All-Bountiful!

O God, my God!  Thy call hath attracted me, and the voice of Thy Pen of Glory awakened me.  The stream of Thy holy utterance hath enraptured me, and the wine of Thine inspiration entranced me.  Thou seest me, O Lord, detached from all things but Thee, clinging to the cord of Thy bounty and craving the wonders of Thy grace.  I ask Thee, by the eternal billows of Thy loving-kindness and the shining lights of Thy tender care and favor, to grant that which shall draw me nigh unto Thee and make me rich in Thy wealth.  My tongue, my pen, my whole being, testify to Thy power, Thy might, Thy grace and Thy bounty, that Thou art God and there is none other God but Thee, the Powerful, the Mighty.
I bear witness at this moment, O my God, to my helplessness and Thy sovereignty, my feebleness and Thy power.  I know not that which profiteth me or harmeth me; Thou art, verily, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.  Do Thou decree for me, O Lord, my God, and my Master, that which will make me feel content with Thine eternal decree and will prosper me in every world of Thine.  Thou art in truth the Gracious, the Bountiful.
Lord!  Turn me not away from the ocean of Thy wealth and the heaven of Thy mercy, and ordain for me the good of this world and hereafter. Verily, Thou art the Lord of the mercy-seat, enthroned in the highest; there is none other God but Thee, the One, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
