O my God, the God of bounty and mercy! Thou art that King by Whose commanding word the whole creation hath been called into being; and Thou art that All-Bountiful One the doings of Whose servants have never hindered Him from showing forth His grace, nor have they frustrated the revelations of His bounty.
Suffer this servant, I beseech Thee, to attain unto that which is the cause of his salvation in every world of Thy worlds.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.
