O Lord!  I am a child; enable me to grow beneath the shadow of Thy loving-kindness.  I am a tender plant; cause me to be nurtured through the outpourings of the clouds of Thy bounty.  I am a sapling of the garden of love; make me into a fruitful tree.
Thou art the Mighty and the Powerful, and Thou art the All-Loving, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.
