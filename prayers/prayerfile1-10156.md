In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Exalted, the Most Glorious! 
 
O God, my God!  Thou seest how Thy servant hath set his face towards Thee and desired to be honoured by performing that whereunto he hath been bidden in Thy Book.  Do Thou ordain for him through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall draw him nigh unto the Most Sublime Summit.  Thou, verily, art the Educator of the world and the Lord of the nations, and Thou, verily, art the Potent, the All-Subduing, the Almighty.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
