*Come ye together in gladness unalloyed, and at the beginning of the meeting, recite ye this prayer:



O Thou Lord of the Kingdom!  Though our bodies be gathered here together, yet our spellbound hearts are carried away by Thy love, and yet are we transported by the rays of Thy resplendent face.  Weak though we be, we await the revelations of Thy might and power.  Poor though we be, with neither goods nor means, still take we riches from the treasures of Thy Kingdom.  Drops though we be, still do we draw from out Thy ocean deeps.  Motes though we be, still do we gleam in the glory of Thy splendid Sun.
O Thou our Provider!  Send down Thine aid, that each one gathered here may become a lighted candle, each one a center of attraction, each one a summoner to Thy heavenly realms, till at last we make this nether world the mirror image of Thy Paradise.
