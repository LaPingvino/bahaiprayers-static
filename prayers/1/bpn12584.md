O my eternal Beloved and my adored Friend!  How long shall I remain bereft of Thy presence and sorely afflicted by remoteness from Thee?  To the retreats of Thy heavenly Kingdom lead me, and at the scene of the appearance of Thy supernal Realm cast upon me the glance of Thy loving-kindness.

O Thou Omnipotent Lord!  Number me among the denizens of the Kingdom.  This mortal world is my abode; grant me a habitation in the realms of the Placeless.  To this earthly plane I pertain; shed upon me the effulgence of Thy glorious light.  In this world of dust I dwell; make me an inmate of Thy heavenly realm, so that I may lay down my life in Thy path and attain to my heart’s desire, may crown my head with the diadem of divine favour and raise the triumphal cry of “O Glory of God, the Most Glorious!”

-- Abdu'l-Bahá
