He is the All-Glorious! 
 
Praise be to Thee, O my God!  Thou didst call me, and I answered Thee.  Thou didst summon me, and I hastened unto Thee, entering beneath the shade of Thy mercy and seeking shelter at the threshold of the door of Thy grace.  Thou hast nurtured me, O Lord, through Thy providence, chosen me for Thee alone, created me for Thy service, and appointed me to stand before Thee.  I beseech Thee, by Thine all-glorious Name and by Thy beauty that hath dawned above the horizon of Thy most exalted Essence, to cause me to be related to Thee even as Thou hadst done so aforetime, and not to separate me from Thyself.  Cause then to appear from me, O my God, that which is worthy of Thee.  Thou art, in truth, powerful over all things.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
