O Lord!  What an outpouring of bounty Thou hast vouchsafed, and what a flood of abounding grace Thou has granted!  Thou didst make all the hearts to become even as a single heart, and all the souls to be bound together as one soul.  Thou didst endow inert bodies with life and feeling, and didst bestow upon lifeless frames the consciousness of the spirit.  Through the effulgent rays shed from the Day-Star of the All-Merciful, Thou didst invest these atoms of dust with visible existence, and through the billows of the ocean of oneness, Thou didst enable these evanescent drops to surge and roar.

O Almighty One Who endowest a blade of straw with the might of a mountain and enablest a speck of dust to mirror forth the glory of the resplendent sun!  Grant us Thy tender grace and favour, so that we may arise to serve Thy Cause and not be shamefaced before the peoples of the earth.
