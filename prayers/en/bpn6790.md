Glory be to Thee, O God, for Thy manifestation of love to mankind!  O Thou Who art our Life and Light, guide Thy servants in Thy way, and make us rich in Thee and free from all save Thee.  

O God, teach us Thy Oneness and give us a realization of Thy Unity, that we may see no one save Thee.  Thou art the Merciful and the Giver of bounty!  

O God, create in the hearts of Thy beloved the fire of Thy love, that it may consume the thought of everything save Thee. 

Reveal to us, O God, Thine exalted eternity - that Thou hast ever been and wilt ever be, and that there is no God save Thee.  Verily, in Thee will we find comfort and strength.
