O Lord! 
 
Help this daughter of the Kingdom to be exalted in both worlds; cause her to turn away from this mortal world of dust and from those who have set their hearts thereon and enable her to have communion and close association with the world of immortality.  Give her heavenly power and strengthen her through the breaths of the Holy Spirit that she may arise to serve Thee. 
Thou art the Mighty One.

-- Abdu'l-Bahá
