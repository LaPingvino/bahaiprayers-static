O Thou most glorious Lord!  Make this little maidservant of Thine blessed and happy; cause her to be cherished at the threshold of Thy oneness, and let her drink deep from the cup of Thy love so that she may be filled with rapture and ecstasy and diffuse sweet-scented fragrance.  Thou art the Mighty and the Powerful, and Thou art the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing.
