<div id="inner">
<p>O Thou kind and loving Providence!  The east is astir and the west surgeth even as the eternal billows of the sea.  The gentle breezes of holiness are diffused and, from the Unseen Kingdom, the rays of the Orb of Truth shine forth resplendent.  The anthems of divine unity are being chanted and the ensigns of celestial might are waving.  The angelic Voice is raised and, even as the roaring of the leviathan, soundeth the call to selflessness and evanescence.  The triumphal cry Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá resoundeth on every side, and the call Yá ‘Alíyyu’l-‘Alá¹ ringeth throughout all regions.  No stir is there in the world save that of the Glory of the One Ravisher of Hearts, and no tumult is there save the surging of the love of Him, the Incomparable, the Well-Beloved.
The beloved of the Lord, with their musk-scented breath, burn like bright candles in every clime, and the friends of the All-Merciful, even as unfolding flowers, can be found in all regions.  Not for a moment do they rest; they breathe not but in remembrance of Thee, and crave naught but to serve Thy Cause.  In the meadows of truth they are as sweet-singing nightingales, and in the flower garden of guidance they are even as brightly-colored blossoms.  With mystic flowers they adorn the walks of the Garden of Reality; as swaying cypresses they line the riverbanks of the Divine Will.  Above the horizon of being they shine as radiant stars; in the firmament of the world they gleam as resplendent orbs.  Manifestations of celestial grace are they, and daysprings of the light of divine assistance.
Grant, O Thou Loving Lord, that all may stand firm and steadfast, shining with everlasting splendor, so that, at every breath, gentle breezes may blow from the bowers of Thy loving-kindness, that from the ocean of Thy grace a mist may rise, that the kindly showers of Thy love may bestow freshness, and the zephyr waft its perfume from the rose garden of divine unity.
Vouchsafe, O Best Beloved of the World, a ray from Thy Splendor.  O Well-Beloved of mankind, shed upon us the light of Thy Countenance.
O God Omnipotent, do Thou shield us and be our refuge and, O Lord of Being, show forth Thy might and Thy dominion.
O Thou loving Lord, the movers of sedition are in some regions astir and active, and by night and day are inflicting a grievous wrong.
Even as wolves, tyrants are lying in wait, and the wronged, innocent flock hath neither help nor succor. Hounds are on the trail of the gazelles of the fields of divine unity, and the pheasant in the mountains of heavenly guidance is pursued by the ravens of envy.
O Thou divine Providence, preserve and protect us!  O Thou Who art our Shield, save us and defend us!  Keep us beneath Thy Shelter, and by Thy Help save us from all ills.  Thou art, indeed, the True Protector, the Unseen Guardian, the Celestial Preserver, and the Heavenly Loving Lord.</p>
