<a href="../../../../prayer/marriage/bh03181/">&lt;&lt; Prayer BH03181</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>He is the Bestower, the Bounteous!
Praise be to God, the Ancient, the Ever-Abiding, the Changeless, the Eternal!  He Who hath testified in His Own Being that verily He is the One, the Single, the Untrammelled, the Exalted.  We bear witness that verily there is no God but Him, acknowledging His oneness, confessing His singleness.  He hath ever dwelt in unapproachable heights, in the summits of His loftiness, sanctified from the mention of aught save Himself, free from the description of aught but Him.
And when He desired to manifest grace and beneficence to men, and to set the world in order, He revealed observances and created laws; among them He established the law of marriage, made it as a fortress for well-being and salvation, and enjoined it upon us in that which was sent down out of the heaven of sanctity in His Most Holy Book.  He saith, great is His glory: “Enter into wedlock, O people, that ye may bring forth one who will make mention of me amid My servants.  This is My bidding unto you; hold fast to it as an assistance to yourselves.”</p>
