<a href="../../../../prayer/steadfastness/ab00687see/">&lt;&lt; Prayer AB00687SEE</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>O Thou, my God, Who guidest the seeker to the pathway that leadeth aright, Who deliverest the lost and blinded soul out of the wastes of perdition, Thou Who bestowest upon the sincere great bounties and favors, Who guardest the frightened within Thine impregnable refuge, Who answerest, from Thine all-highest horizon, the cry of those who cry out unto Thee.  Praised be Thou, O my Lord!  Thou hast guided the distracted out of the death of unbelief, and hast brought those who draw nigh unto Thee to the journey&rsquo;s goal, and hast rejoiced the assured among Thy servants by granting them their most cherished desires, and hast, from Thy Kingdom of beauty, opened before the faces of those who yearn after Thee the gates of reunion, and hast rescued them from the fires of deprivation and loss—so that they hastened unto Thee and gained Thy presence, and arrived at Thy welcoming door, and received of gifts an abundant share.
O my Lord, they thirsted, Thou didst lift to their parched lips the waters of reunion.  O Tender One, Bestowing One, Thou didst calm their pain with the balm of Thy bounty and grace, and didst heal their ailments with the sovereign medicine of Thy compassion.  O Lord, make firm their feet on Thy straight path, make wide for them the needle&rsquo;s eye, and cause them, dressed in royal robes, to walk in glory for ever and ever.
Verily, Thou art the Generous, the Ever-Giving, the Precious, the Most Bountiful.  There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Exalted, the Victorious.</p>
