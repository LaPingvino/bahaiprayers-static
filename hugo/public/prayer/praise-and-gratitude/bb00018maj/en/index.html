<h1>Prayer BB00018MAJ in English</h1>

<a href="../../../../prayer/praise-and-gratitude/bb00018maj/">&lt;&lt; Prayer BB00018MAJ</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>All majesty and glory, O my God, and all dominion and light and grandeur and splendor be unto Thee.  Thou bestowest sovereignty on whom Thou willest and dost withhold it from whom Thou desirest.  No God is there but Thee, the All-Possessing, the Most Exalted.  Thou art He Who createth from naught the universe and all that dwell therein. There is nothing worthy of Thee except Thyself, while all else but Thee are as outcasts in Thy holy presence and are as nothing when compared to the glory of Thine Own Being.
Far be it from me to extol Thy virtues save by what Thou hast extolled Thyself in Thy weighty Book where Thou sayest, “No vision taketh in Him, but He taketh in all vision.  He is the Subtile, the All-Perceiving.”¹  Glory be unto Thee, O my God, indeed no mind or vision, however keen or discriminating, can ever grasp the nature of the most insignificant of Thy signs.  Verily, Thou art God, no God is there besides Thee.  I bear witness that Thou Thyself alone art the sole expression of Thine attributes, that the praise of no one besides Thee can ever attain to Thy holy court nor can Thine attributes ever be fathomed by anyone other than Thyself.
Glory be unto Thee, Thou art exalted above the description of anyone save Thyself, since it is beyond human conception to befittingly magnify Thy virtues or to comprehend the inmost reality of Thine Essence.  Far be it from Thy glory that Thy creatures should describe Thee or that anyone besides Thyself should ever know Thee.  I have known Thee, O my God, by reason of Thy making Thyself known unto me, for hadst Thou not revealed Thyself unto me, I would not have known Thee.  I worship Thee by virtue of Thy summoning me unto Thee, for had it not been for Thy summons I would not have worshiped Thee.</p>
