<a href="../../../../prayer/tests-and-difficulties/bh05071/">&lt;&lt; Prayer BH05071</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>Lauded and glorified art Thou, O my God!  I entreat Thee by the sighing of Thy lovers and by the tears shed by them that long to behold Thee, not to withhold from me Thy tender mercies in Thy Day, nor to deprive me of the melodies of the Dove that extolleth Thy oneness before the light that shineth from Thy face.  I am the one who is in misery, O God!  Behold me cleaving fast to Thy Name, the All-Possessing.  I am the one who is sure to perish; behold me clinging to Thy Name, the Imperishable.  I implore Thee, therefore, by Thy Self, the Exalted, the Most High, not to abandon me unto mine own self and unto the desires of a corrupt inclination.  Hold Thou my hand with the hand of Thy power, and deliver me from the depths of my fancies and idle imaginings, and cleanse me of all that is abhorrent unto thee.
Cause me, then, to turn wholly unto Thee, to put my whole trust in Thee, to seek Thee as my Refuge, and to flee unto Thy face.  Thou art, verily, He Who, through the power of His might, doeth whatsoever He desireth, and commandeth, through the potency of His will, whatsoever He chooseth.  None can withstand the operation of Thy decree; none can divert the course of Thine appointment.  Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.</p>
