<a href="../../../../prayer/teaching/bh00308des/">&lt;&lt; Prayer BH00308DES</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, O Thou Who hast become manifest in the Greatest Name, whereby the pearls of wisdom and utterance have appeared from the shells of the great sea of Thy knowledge, and the heavens of divine revelation have been adorned with the light of the appearance of the sun of Thy countenance.
I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected among Thy creatures and Thy testimony was fulfilled amidst Thy servants, to strengthen Thy people in that whereby the face of the Cause will radiate in Thy dominion, the standards of Thy power will be planted among Thy servants, and the banners of Thy guidance will be raised throughout Thy dominions.
O my Lord!  Thou beholdest them clinging to the rope of Thy grace and holding fast unto the hem of the mantle of Thy beneficence.  Ordain for them that which may draw them nearer unto Thee, and withhold them from all else save Thee.
I beg of Thee, O Thou King of existence and Protector of the seen and the unseen, to make whosoever arises to serve Thy Cause as a sea moving by Thy desire, as one ablaze with the fire of Thy Sacred Tree, shining from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will.  Verily, Thou art the mighty One, Whom neither the power of all the world nor the strength of nations can weaken.  There is no God but Thee, the One, the Incomparable, the Protector, the Self-Subsistent.</p>
