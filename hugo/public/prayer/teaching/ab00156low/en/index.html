<a href="../../../../prayer/teaching/ab00156low/">&lt;&lt; Prayer AB00156LOW</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>Thou seest me, O my God, bowed down in lowliness, humbling myself before Thy commandments, submitting to Thy sovereignty, trembling at the might of Thy dominion, fleeing from Thy wrath, entreating Thy grace, relying upon Thy forgiveness, shaking with awe at Thy fury.  I implore Thee with a throbbing heart, with streaming tears and a yearning soul, and in complete detachment from all things, to make Thy lovers as rays of light across Thy realms, and to aid Thy chosen servants to exalt Thy Word, that their faces may turn beauteous and bright with splendor, that their hearts may be filled with mysteries, and that every soul may lay down its burden of sin.  Guard them then from the aggressor, from him who hath become a shameless and blasphemous doer of wrong.
Verily, Thy lovers thirst, O my Lord; lead them to the wellspring of bounty and grace.  Verily, they hunger; send down unto them Thy heavenly table.  Verily, they are naked; robe them in the garments of learning and knowledge.
Heroes are they, O my Lord, lead them to the field of battle.  Guides are they, make them to speak out with arguments and proofs. Ministering servants are they, cause them to pass round the cup that brimmeth with the wine of certitude.  O my God, make them to be songsters that carol in fair gardens, make them lions that couch in the thickets, whales that plunge in the vasty deep.
Verily, Thou art He of abounding grace.  There is none other God save Thee, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Ever-Bestowing.</p>
