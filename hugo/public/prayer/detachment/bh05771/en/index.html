<div id="inner">
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O my God!  I am one of Thy servants, who hath believed on Thee and on Thy signs.  Thou seest how I have set myself towards the door of Thy mercy, and turned my face in the direction of Thy loving-kindness.  I beseech Thee, by Thy most excellent titles and Thy most exalted attributes, to open to my face the portals of Thy bestowals.  Aid me, then, to do that which is good, O Thou Who art the Posessor of all names and attributes!
I am poor, O my Lord, and Thou art the Rich.  I have set my face towards Thee, and detached myself from all but Thee.  Deprive me not, I implore Thee, of the breezes of Thy tender mercy, and withhold not from me what Thou didst ordain for the chosen among Thy servants.
Remove the veil from mine eyes, O my Lord, that I may recognize what Thou hast desired for Thy creatures, and discover, in all the manifestations of Thy handiwork, the revelations of Thine almighty power.  Enrapture my soul, O my Lord, with Thy most mighty signs, and draw me out of the depths of my corrupt and evil desires.  Write down, then, for me the good of this world and of the world to come.  Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  No God is there but Thee, the All-Glorious, Whose help is sought by all men.
I yield Thee thanks, O my Lord, that Thou hast wakened me from my sleep, and stirred me up, and created in me the desire to perceive what most of Thy servants have failed to apprehend.  Make me able, therefore, O my Lord, to behold, for love of Thee and for the sake of Thy pleasure, whatsoever Thou hast desired.  Thou art He to the power of Whose might and sovereignty all things testify.
There is none other God but Thee, the Almighty, the Beneficent.</p>
