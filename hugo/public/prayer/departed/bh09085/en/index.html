<h1>Prayer for the Dead in English</h1>

<a href="../../../../prayer/departed/bh09085/">&lt;&lt; Prayer for the Dead</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>*The Prayer for the Dead is the only Bahá’í obligatory prayer that is to be recited in congregation; it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in silence.  Bahá’u’lláh has clarified that this prayer is required only when the deceased is over the age of fifteen, that its recital must precede interment, and that there is no requirement to face the Qiblih during its recitation.  “Alláh-u-Abhá” is said once; then the first of the six verses is recited nineteen times.  Then “Alláh-u-Abhá” is said again, followed by the second verse, which is recited nineteen times, and so on.</p>
<p>O my God!  This is Thy servant and the son of Thy servant who hath believed in Thee and in Thy signs, and set his face towards Thee, wholly detached from all except Thee.  Thou art, verily, of those who show mercy the most merciful.</p>
<p>Deal with him, O Thou Who forgivest the sins of men and concealest their faults, as beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy grace.  Grant him admission within the precincts of Thy transcendent mercy that was before the foundation of earth and heaven. There is no God but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.</p>
<p>*Let him, then, repeat six times the greeting “Alláh-u-Abhá,” and then repeat nineteen times each of the following verses:</p>
<p>We all, verily, worship God.
We all, verily, bow down before God.
We all, verily, are devoted unto God.
We all, verily, give praise unto God.
We all, verily, yield thanks unto God.
We all, verily, are patient in God.</p>
<p>*(If the dead be a woman, let him say: This is Thy handmaiden and the daughter of Thy handmaiden, etc&hellip;)</p>
