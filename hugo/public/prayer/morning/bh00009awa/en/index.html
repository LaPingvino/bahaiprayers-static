<a href="../../../../prayer/morning/bh00009awa/">&lt;&lt; Prayer BH00009AWA</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>I give praise to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast awakened me out of my sleep, and brought me forth after my disappearance, and raised me up from my slumber.  I have wakened this morning with my face set toward the splendors of the Daystar of thy Revelation, through Which the heavens of Thy power and Thy majesty have been illumined, acknowledging Thy signs, believing in Thy Book, and holding fast unto Thy Cord.
I beseech Thee, by the potency of Thy will and the compelling power of Thy purpose, to make of what Thou didst reveal unto me in my sleep the surest foundation for the mansions of Thy love that are within the hearts of Thy loved ones, and the best instrument for the revelation of the tokens of Thy grace and Thy loving-kindness.
Do Thou ordain for me through Thy most exalted Pen, O my Lord, the good of this world and of the next.  I testify that within Thy grasp are held the reins of all things.  Thou changest them as Thou pleasest.  No God is there save Thee, the Strong, the Faithful.
Thou art He Who changeth through His bidding abasement into glory, and weakness into strength, and powerlessness into might, and fear into calm, and doubt into certainty.  No God is there but Thee, the Mighty, the Beneficent.
Thou disappointest no one who hath sought Thee, nor dost Thou keep back from Thee anyone who hath desired Thee.  Ordain Thou for me what becometh the heaven of Thy generosity, and the ocean of Thy bounty. Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.</p>
