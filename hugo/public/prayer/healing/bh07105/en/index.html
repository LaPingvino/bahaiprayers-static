<a href="../../../../prayer/healing/bh07105/">&lt;&lt; Prayer BH07105</a>

<div id="inner">
<p>Praised be Thou, O Lord my God!  I implore Thee, by Thy Most Great Name through which Thou didst stir up Thy servants and build up Thy cities, and by Thy most excellent titles, and Thy most august attributes, to assist Thy people to turn in the direction of Thy manifold bounties, and set their faces towards the Tabernacle of Thy wisdom.  Heal Thou the sicknesses that have assailed the souls on every side, and have deterred them from directing their gaze towards the Paradise that lieth in the shelter of Thy shadowing Name, which Thou didst ordain to be the King of all names unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.  Potent art Thou to do as pleaseth Thee.  In Thy hands is the empire of all names.  There is none other God but Thee, the Mighty, the Wise.
I am but a poor creature, O my Lord; I have clung to the hem of Thy riches.  I am sore sick; I have held fast the cord of Thy healing. Deliver me from the ills that have encircled me, and wash me thoroughly with the waters of Thy graciousness and mercy, and attire me with the raiment of wholesomeness, through Thy forgiveness and bounty.  Fix, then, mine eyes upon Thee, and rid me of all attachment to aught else except Thyself.  Aid me to do what Thou desirest, and to fulfill what Thou pleasest.
Thou art truly the Lord of this life and of the next.  Thou art, in truth, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.</p>
