<p>He is God.</p>
<p>O God, my God!  With utter lowliness and fervour, humility and devotion, I implore Thee with my tongue and my heart, with my spirit and my soul, and with my mind and my conscience, to grant the most cherished of all desires, destine the most meritorious of all deeds, and ordain all honour and perfection, favour and beauty, prosperity and salvation for this family that hath hastened to Thy sheltering shadow at the break of Thy resplendent morn and sought refuge within Thy safe haven and Thy mighty stronghold.  Verily, these souls heeded Thy call, drew nigh unto Thy Threshold, were set aflame with the fire of Thy love, and were carried away by the breaths of Thy holiness.  They were constant in the service of Thy Cause, humble before Thy Countenance, and noble beneath Thy sheltering shadow.  They are renowned as the bearers of Thy name amongst Thy people and make mention of Thee amidst Thy servants.</p>
<p>O God, my God!  Exalt them by Thine ancient glory, honour them in Thy Kingdom of grandeur, and assist them with the hosts of Thy favours in this great Day.  O Lord, my God!  Raise aloft their banner, grant them an ampler share of Thy protection, spread abroad their signs, and increase their radiance, that they may become a glass for the lamp of Thy manifold favours and spreaders of Thy loving-kindness and bounties.</p>
<p>O Lord, my God!  Be Thou their companion in their loneliness, and in their moments of anguish surround them with Thine aid.  Bequeath unto them Thy Book and vouchsafe unto them the full measure of Thy gifts and bestowals.  Thou art in truth the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious, the Bountiful, and verily, Thou art the Merciful, the Compassionate.</p>
