<h1>Prayer bpn12585 in English</h1>

<div id="inner">
<p>O Thou kind Lord!  These souls are Thy friends who are gathered together and are carried away by Thy love.  They are transported by the rays of Thy beauty and captivated by Thy musk-laden locks.  They have surrendered their hearts to Thee and, lowly and helpless, wander in Thy path.  They have forsaken friend and stranger alike and have laid hold of Thy unity, bowing in adoration before Thee.</p>
<p>They belonged to this nether world; Thou didst welcome them into Thy Kingdom.  They were as withered plants in the wilderness of deprivation and loss; Thou didst make them the saplings of the garden of knowledge and understanding.  Their voices were stilled; Thou didst cause them to speak forth.  They were dispirited; Thou didst shed illumination upon them.  They were as parched and barren soil; Thou didst turn them into a rose-garden of inner meanings.  They were as children in the world of humanity; Thou didst enable them to attain heavenly maturity.</p>
<p>O Thou kind One!  Grant them a haven and a refuge within the shelter of Thy protection, and shield them from tests and trials.  Lend them Thine invisible assistance, and confer upon them Thine infallible grace.</p>
<p>O Thou kind and beloved Lord!  They are as the body, and Thou art the Spirit of life.  The body is dependent for its freshness and beauty upon the grace of the spirit.  They stand, therefore, in need of Thy confirmations and yearn for the sustaining power of the Holy Spirit in this new Revelation.  Thou art the Mighty.  Thou art the Giver, the Provider, the Bestower, and the Forgiver.  Thou are the One Who shineth brightly from the invisible Realm.</p>
