<p>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious.
Praise be to Thee, O my God, that the dawn of Thy Ridván Festival hath broken, and that therein one who had sought Thy presence hath attained his goal, O Thou our Lord, the Most Merciful! How numerous are Thy loved ones, O my God, who traversed the sands of Syria in their longing to gaze on Thy beauty but who were prevented from attaining the court of Thy transcendent oneness by reason of the misdeeds of Thy foes, who have disbelieved in Thee and gainsaid Thy sovereignty.</p><hr />

<p>He is God.
O Lord, my God, my Best-Beloved, my Aim, my heart’s Desire! This, verily, is the first of the days of Riḍván. It is come with joy and delight, exultation and rapture. The winds are wafting, the clouds are raining down, and the sun is shining forth through Thy bountiful grace. The morning breeze bloweth over hill and dale in this wondrous Springtime, as a token of Thine inestimable favour, transforming these lands into a fine brocade of incomparable hues and a silken carpet begemmed with flowers and adorned with a vesture of verdant leaves that dazzle the eyes with their gleaming splendour.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/sk/bpn13244/">Prayer bpn13244 in Slovensky</a></h2>
<p>Toto je sviatok Riḍvánu, jarné obdobie, v ktorom sa medzi nebom a zemou zjavila Krása nadovšetko Slávneho. Na príkaz Toho, ktorý je Najchválenejší, sa v tomto úžasnom dni pred tvárou všetkých ľudí dokorán otvorili brány raja, a prúd božského milosrdenstva zapršal z oblakov nebeskej milosti na Jeho nespočetné stelesnenia a prejavy vo svete bytia.

<p>*V mene Toho, kto naplnil Svojou nádherou celé stvorenie! Nadišla božská vesna, ó Najvznešenejšie pero! Veď slávnosť nadovšetko Milosrdného sa rýchlo blíži. Pousiluj sa a pred celým stvorením blahoreč menu Božiemu a oslavuj Jeho chválu tak, aby všetko stvorené mohlo byť znovuzrodené a obnovené. Nemlč a prevrávaj! Dennica blaženosti žiari nad obzorom Nášho mena Blažený, pretože kráľovstvo mena Božieho bolo okrášlené ozdobou mena tvojho Pána, Stvoriteľa nebies. Povstaň pred národmi zeme a vyzbroj sa mocou tohto Najväčšieho mena.</p><hr />

<p>##Lawḥ-i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq *(Tabuľka Milujúceho a Milovaného)
On je Vznešený, všetko Prevyšujúci, Najvyšší.
Ó sláviky Božie, vysloboďte sa z tŕnia a húštiny biednosti a úbohosti a vzlietnite k ružovej záhrade nepomíňajúcej nádhery. Ó priatelia Moji spočívajúci na prachu! Ponáhľajte sa do nebeského obydlia. Oznámte si šťastnú zvesť: „Ten, kto je nadovšetko Milovaný, prišiel! Korunoval sa slávou Božieho zjavenia a pred tvárou ľudí odomkol dvercia Svojho pradávneho raja.“ Nech sa všetky oči radujú a nech sa poteší každé ucho, pretože teraz nastal čas, aby ste pohliadli na Jeho krásu, teraz nastal vhodný čas na to, aby ste načúvali Jeho hlasu.</p><hr />

<p>In the name of Him Who hath cast His splendour over the entire creation!
The Divine Springtime is come, O Most Exalted Pen, for the Festival of the All-Merciful is fast approaching. Bestir thyself, and magnify, before the entire creation, the name of God, and celebrate His praise, in such wise that all created things may be regenerated and made new. Speak, and hold not thy peace. The day-star of blissfulness shineth above the horizon of Our name, the Blissful, inasmuch as the kingdom of the names of God hath been adorned with the ornament of the name of thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8237/">Prayer bpn8237 in English</a></h2>
<p>He it is Who is established upon this luminous Throne.
Proclaim unto the celestial Concourse, O Pen of effulgent glory, that lo, the veil of concealment hath been rent asunder and the Beauty of the Lord hath been revealed from this Scene of transcendent glory with such radiance as to cause the luminaries of His command to shine above the dayspring of His almighty Name. All hail then to this, the Festival of the Lord, that hath dawned above a horizon of surpassing grace!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8239/">Prayer bpn8239 in English</a></h2>
<p>On the first day that the Ancient Beauty ascended His Most Great Throne in the garden named Ridván, the Tongue of Glory gave utterance to three blessed words. First, that in this Revelation the law of the sword hath been annulled.[3] Second, that ere the expiration of one thousand years whosoever advanceth a prophetic claim is false. By “year” a full year is intended, and no exegesis or interpretation is permitted in this matter.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8240/">Prayer bpn8240 in English</a></h2>
<p>The day-star of words, dawning above the horizon of the utterance of Him Who is the Lord of all names and attributes, hath, at this most blessed of hours, shone forth in all truth with the splendours of the light of God. The spirit of understanding, flowing from the Pen of the All-Glorious, hath, by virtue of His grace, been conferred upon all created things. The mystery of all mysteries, emerging from behind the veils of concealment, hath, in very truth, been revealed to the righteous, as bidden by God, the Almighty, the Unconstrained.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8241/">Prayer bpn8241 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is the Manifest, the Hidden, the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing, the Ever-Forbearing.
O Lord my God! Whensoever I attempt to unloose my tongue to extol the wondrous expressions of Thy transcendent oneness, or to open my lips to disclose the mystic gems of Thine incomparable handiwork wherewith Thou hast inspired me, I am compelled to recognize that all things sing Thy praise and glorify Thy remembrance—a remembrance which hath so pervaded the heavens and the earth that all things proclaim, in their very being, the wondrous testimonies of Thine exalted praise and bear witness to the marvellous tokens of Thy transcendent unity.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8242/">Prayer bpn8242 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Húr-i-‘Ujáb ##Tablet of the Wondrous Maiden
The hallowed Beauty shone resplendent from behind the veil. How wondrous a thing, how wondrous indeed! And, lo, the flame of rapture caused all souls to swoon away. How wondrous is this, how wondrous indeed! Rising up, they soared unto the blest pavilion ’neath the throne of heaven’s canopy. How wondrous a mystery, how wondrous indeed! Say: The Maiden of Eternity unveiled Her face—may her wondrous beauty be exalted indeed!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8243/">Prayer bpn8243 in English</a></h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful!
Glorified art Thou, O my God! I beseech Thee by this Day, and by Him Whom Thy sovereignty and Thy majesty and Thy might have manifested therein, and by the tears which Thine ardent lovers have shed in their remoteness and separation from Thee, and by the fire that hath consumed the hearts of them that yearn to behold Thy beauty, to send down upon us on this Day that which beseemeth Thy beauty and becometh Thy grace and Thy generosity.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8244/">Prayer bpn8244 in English</a></h2>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having cast in this Day the radiance of all Thy names upon all created things, O Thou Who art the Lord of glory, majesty, and grandeur; of power, might, and blessings! This is the Day whereon He Who is the Mouthpiece of God, the All-Possessing, the Inaccessible, the Most High, hath called out from the realm of eternity, saying: “The Kingdom is God’s, the Almighty, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8245/">Prayer bpn8245 in English</a></h2>
<p>In the name of God, Who hath cast His splendour over all creation!
O concourse of earth and heaven! Give ear to the testimony of God that proceedeth from the mouth of your Lord, the All-Glorious. He verily hath testified, in Himself and by Himself, ere the heaven of His Cause was raised up and the clouds of His Decree were gathered together, that there is none other God but Him, and that He Who hath appeared is that Most Great Name through which His ancient proof and testimony have been established before all who are in the heavens and on the earth.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8246/">Prayer bpn8246 in English</a></h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Almighty, the Unconstrained!
Praise be to Thee, O my God, for having gathered together Thy loved ones to celebrate Thy Most Great Festival, whereon Thou didst shed the splendour of Thy most excellent names upon all who are in heaven and on earth, the Festival whereon the Day-Star of truth hath shone resplendent above the horizon of Thy will and the Ancient King ascended the throne of Thy mercy.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8247/">Prayer bpn8247 in English</a></h2>
<p>In the name of God, the Most Glorious!
Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! This is one of the days of Thy Ridván Festival whereon Thou didst shed the splendour of Thy name, the All-Merciful, upon all the peoples of the earth, and didst manifest Thy power and Thy sovereignty unto all created things. Thou seest, O Lord, how on this day one of Thy loved ones hath invited the Manifestation of Thine Essence from His room to another room in this prison, wherein a gathering hath been held in Thy name and adorned with the ornament of Thine own Self, in such wise that the Sun of Thy beauty hath shone forth above its horizon.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8248/">Prayer bpn8248 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God.
Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! This is one of the days of Thy Ridván Festival whereon a corner of this prison hath been decked forth for the appearance of Him Who is the Exponent of Thy beauty, granting the request of one whose ardent devotion hath prompted him to invite Thee. All praise be to Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast, as a token of Thy bounty unto them that abide beneath Thy shadow and circle round Thy being, shone forth on this day above the horizon of the prison with such splendour as to illumine the entire creation.</p><hr />

<p>#Lawh-i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq ##Tablet of the Lover and the Beloved
He is the Exalted, the Transcendent, the All-Highest.
Release yourselves, O nightingales of God, from the thorns and brambles of wretchedness and misery, and wing your flight to the rose-garden of unfading splendour. O My friends that dwell upon the dust! Haste forth unto your celestial habitation. Announce unto yourselves the joyful tidings: “He Who is the Best-Beloved is come! He hath crowned Himself with the glory of God’s Revelation, and hath unlocked to the face of men the doors of His ancient Paradise.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8250/">Prayer bpn8250 in English</a></h2>
<p>In Thy name, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious!
Since Thou hast, O my God, stablished Thyself upon the throne of Thy transcendent unity, and ascended the mercy-seat of Thy oneness, it befitteth Thee to blot out from the hearts of all beings whatsoever may keep them back from gaining admittance into the sanctuary of Thy Divine mysteries, and may shut them out from the tabernacle of Thy Divinity, that all hearts may mirror Thy beauty, and may reveal Thee, and speak of Thee, and that all created things may show forth the tokens of Thy most august sovereignty, and shed the splendours of the light of Thy most holy governance, and that all who are in heaven and on earth may laud and magnify Thy unity, and give Thee glory, for having manifested Thy Self unto them through Him Who is the Revealer of Thy oneness.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8251/">Prayer bpn8251 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Súriy-i-Qalam ##Súrih of the Pen
This is the Súrih of the Pen, which hath been sent down from the heaven of eternity unto them that have fixed their gaze upon His Throne.
In the name of God, the Most Wondrous, the Most Glorious!
O Pen of the Most High! Bear thou witness, in thine own self, that verily He is God and that there is none other God but Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8252/">Prayer bpn8252 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is the Ever-Abiding.
It is the Festival of Ridván, the vernal season wherein the Beauty of the All-Glorious was revealed betwixt earth and heaven. In this wondrous Day the gates of Paradise were flung open before the faces of all people, at the behest of Him Who is the All-Praised, and the outpourings of divine mercy rained down from the clouds of celestial favour upon His countless embodiments and manifestations in the world of being.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8253/">Prayer bpn8253 in English</a></h2>
<p>Another letter of thine, which made mention of the hallowed and blessed days of Ridván, was received. Praise be to God, there wafted therefrom the sweet savours of the rose-garden of true knowledge and inner meaning. Should the people of the world resolve, one and all, to extol the days that We passed in the garden of Najíb Páshá, which hath been designated as the Garden of Ridván, they would find themselves utterly incapable thereof and would confess to their powerlessness.</p><hr />
