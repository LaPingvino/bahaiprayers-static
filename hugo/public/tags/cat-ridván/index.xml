      <description>He is the Most Holy, the Most Glorious.
Praise be to Thee, O my God, that the dawn of Thy Ridván Festival hath broken, and that therein one who had sought Thy presence hath attained his goal, O Thou our Lord, the Most Merciful! How numerous are Thy loved ones, O my God, who traversed the sands of Syria in their longing to gaze on Thy beauty but who were prevented from attaining the court of Thy transcendent oneness by reason of the misdeeds of Thy foes, who have disbelieved in Thee and gainsaid Thy sovereignty.</description>

      <description>He is God.
O Lord, my God, my Best-Beloved, my Aim, my heart’s Desire! This, verily, is the first of the days of Riḍván. It is come with joy and delight, exultation and rapture. The winds are wafting, the clouds are raining down, and the sun is shining forth through Thy bountiful grace. The morning breeze bloweth over hill and dale in this wondrous Springtime, as a token of Thine inestimable favour, transforming these lands into a fine brocade of incomparable hues and a silken carpet begemmed with flowers and adorned with a vesture of verdant leaves that dazzle the eyes with their gleaming splendour.</description>

      <description>Toto je sviatok Riḍvánu, jarné obdobie, v ktorom sa medzi nebom a zemou zjavila Krása nadovšetko Slávneho. Na príkaz Toho, ktorý je Najchválenejší, sa v tomto úžasnom dni pred tvárou všetkých ľudí dokorán otvorili brány raja, a prúd božského milosrdenstva zapršal z oblakov nebeskej milosti na Jeho nespočetné stelesnenia a prejavy vo svete bytia.

      <description>*V mene Toho, kto naplnil Svojou nádherou celé stvorenie! Nadišla božská vesna, ó Najvznešenejšie pero! Veď slávnosť nadovšetko Milosrdného sa rýchlo blíži. Pousiluj sa a pred celým stvorením blahoreč menu Božiemu a oslavuj Jeho chválu tak, aby všetko stvorené mohlo byť znovuzrodené a obnovené. Nemlč a prevrávaj! Dennica blaženosti žiari nad obzorom Nášho mena Blažený, pretože kráľovstvo mena Božieho bolo okrášlené ozdobou mena tvojho Pána, Stvoriteľa nebies. Povstaň pred národmi zeme a vyzbroj sa mocou tohto Najväčšieho mena.</description>

      <description>##Lawḥ-i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq *(Tabuľka Milujúceho a Milovaného)
On je Vznešený, všetko Prevyšujúci, Najvyšší.
Ó sláviky Božie, vysloboďte sa z tŕnia a húštiny biednosti a úbohosti a vzlietnite k ružovej záhrade nepomíňajúcej nádhery. Ó priatelia Moji spočívajúci na prachu! Ponáhľajte sa do nebeského obydlia. Oznámte si šťastnú zvesť: „Ten, kto je nadovšetko Milovaný, prišiel! Korunoval sa slávou Božieho zjavenia a pred tvárou ľudí odomkol dvercia Svojho pradávneho raja.“ Nech sa všetky oči radujú a nech sa poteší každé ucho, pretože teraz nastal čas, aby ste pohliadli na Jeho krásu, teraz nastal vhodný čas na to, aby ste načúvali Jeho hlasu.</description>

      <description>In the name of Him Who hath cast His splendour over the entire creation!
The Divine Springtime is come, O Most Exalted Pen, for the Festival of the All-Merciful is fast approaching. Bestir thyself, and magnify, before the entire creation, the name of God, and celebrate His praise, in such wise that all created things may be regenerated and made new. Speak, and hold not thy peace. The day-star of blissfulness shineth above the horizon of Our name, the Blissful, inasmuch as the kingdom of the names of God hath been adorned with the ornament of the name of thy Lord, the Creator of the heavens.</description>

Proclaim unto the celestial Concourse, O Pen of effulgent glory, that lo, the veil of concealment hath been rent asunder and the Beauty of the Lord hath been revealed from this Scene of transcendent glory with such radiance as to cause the luminaries of His command to shine above the dayspring of His almighty Name.

      <description>On the first day that the Ancient Beauty ascended His Most Great Throne in the garden named Ridván, the Tongue of Glory gave utterance to three blessed words. First, that in this Revelation the law of the sword hath been annulled.[3] Second, that ere the expiration of one thousand years whosoever advanceth a prophetic claim is false. By “year” a full year is intended, and no exegesis or interpretation is permitted in this matter.</description>

      <description>The day-star of words, dawning above the horizon of the utterance of Him Who is the Lord of all names and attributes, hath, at this most blessed of hours, shone forth in all truth with the splendours of the light of God. The spirit of understanding, flowing from the Pen of the All-Glorious, hath, by virtue of His grace, been conferred upon all created things. The mystery of all mysteries, emerging from behind the veils of concealment, hath, in very truth, been revealed to the righteous, as bidden by God, the Almighty, the Unconstrained.</description>

O Lord my God! Whensoever I attempt to unloose my tongue to extol the wondrous expressions of Thy transcendent oneness, or to open my lips to disclose the mystic gems of Thine incomparable handiwork wherewith Thou hast inspired me, I am compelled to recognize that all things sing Thy praise and glorify Thy remembrance—a remembrance which hath so pervaded the heavens and the earth that all things proclaim, in their very being, the wondrous testimonies of Thine exalted praise and bear witness to the marvellous tokens of Thy transcendent unity.</description>

The hallowed Beauty shone resplendent from behind the veil. How wondrous a thing, how wondrous indeed! And, lo, the flame of rapture caused all souls to swoon away. How wondrous is this, how wondrous indeed! Rising up, they soared unto the blest pavilion ’neath the throne of heaven’s canopy. How wondrous a mystery, how wondrous indeed! Say: The Maiden of Eternity unveiled Her face—may her wondrous beauty be exalted indeed!</description>

Praise be to God, there wafted therefrom the sweet savours of the rose-garden of true knowledge and inner meaning. Should the people of the world resolve, one and all, to extol the days that We passed in the garden of Najíb Páshá, which hath been designated as the Garden of Ridván, they would find themselves utterly incapable thereof and would confess to their powerlessness.</description>
