<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8261/">Prayer bpn8261 in English</a></h2>
<p>Give ear, O My servant, unto that which is being sent down unto thee from the Throne of thy Lord, the Inaccessible, the Most Great. There is none other God but Him. He hath called into being His creatures, that they may know Him, Who is the Compassionate, the All-Merciful. Unto the cities of all nations He hath sent His Messengers, Whom He hath commissioned to announce unto men tidings of the Paradise of His good-pleasure, and to draw them nigh unto the Haven of abiding security, the Seat of eternal holiness and transcendent glory.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8262/">Prayer bpn8262 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Excerpt from the Súriy-i-Nush ##Súrih of Counsel
Announce unto My servants the advent of the One Who came unto them with the power of truth bearing the name of ‘Alí,[30] Who dawned above the horizon of holiness with the splendours of a cherished glory, and from Whose right hand flowed the crystal streams of the spirit, laying bare the wonders of a hidden knowledge. “O people!” He declared, “The clouds of wisdom have been lifted and God hath revealed His Cause.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8263/">Prayer bpn8263 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Excerpt from the Súriy-i-Mulúk ##Súrih of the Kings
Dost thou imagine, O Minister of the Sháh in the City[31] that I hold within My grasp the ultimate destiny of the Cause of God? Thinkest thou that My imprisonment, or the shame I have been made to suffer, or even My death and utter annihilation, can deflect its course? Wretched is what thou hast imagined in thine heart! Thou art indeed of them that walk after the vain imaginings which their hearts devise.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8264/">Prayer bpn8264 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Excerpt from the Lawh-i-Salmán I ##Tablet to Salmán I
O Salmán! Say: O people! Tread ye in the path of the one true God and ponder the ways and words of Him Who is the Manifestation of His ancient Being, that perchance ye may attain unto the Wellspring of the living waters of the All-Glorious. Were believers and non-believers to occupy the same station, were the worlds of God to be confined to this ephemeral plane, never would My previous Manifestation have surrendered Himself into the hands of His foes or laid down His life as a sacrifice.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8265/">Prayer bpn8265 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Excerpt from the Súriy-i-Dhikr ##Súrih of Remembrance
This is the Súrih of Remembrance, sent down as a token of grace, that perchance the people of the Bayán might renounce that which they possess, turn towards the right hand of justice, shake off the slumber of wayward desires, and seek, through the power of truth, a path to their Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.
In the name of God, the Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most High!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn8266/">Prayer bpn8266 in English</a></h2>
<p>#Excerpt from the Súriy-i-Ahzán ##Súrih of Sorrows
Would that thou wert standing at this moment before the Throne and couldst hear how the melodies of eternity issue from the Temple of Bahá! By the one true God, should His creatures but cleanse their ears, and should they hear but a single strain of these melodies, they would, one and all, fall thunderstruck upon the dust in the presence of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.</p><hr />
