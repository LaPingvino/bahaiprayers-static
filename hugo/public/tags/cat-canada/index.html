<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn11201/">Prayer bpn11201 in English</a></h2>
<p>##Revealed to the Bahá’ís of Canada
*The spreaders of the fragrances of God should recite this prayer every morning:
O God, my God! Thou beholdest this weak one begging for celestial strength, this poor one craving Thy heavenly treasures, this thirsty one longing for the fountain of eternal life, this afflicted one yearning for Thy promised healing through Thy boundless mercy which Thou hast destined for Thy chosen servants in Thy kingdom on high.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn11202/">Prayer bpn11202 in English</a></h2>
<p>##Revealed to the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada
*Whoever sets out on a teaching journey to any place, let him recite this prayer day and night during his travels in foreign lands.
O God, my God! Thou seest me enraptured and attracted toward Thy glorious kingdom, enkindled with the fire of Thy love amongst mankind, a herald of Thy kingdom in these vast and spacious lands, severed from aught else save Thee, relying on Thee, abandoning rest and comfort, remote from my native home, a wanderer in these regions, a stranger fallen upon the ground, humble before Thine exalted Threshold, submissive toward the heaven of Thine omnipotent glory, supplicating Thee in the dead of night and at the break of dawn, entreating and invoking Thee at morn and at eventide to graciously aid me to serve Thy Cause, to spread abroad Thy Teachings and to exalt Thy Word throughout the East and the West.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn11203/">Prayer bpn11203 in English</a></h2>
<p>##Revealed to the Bahá&rsquo;ís of the United States and Canada
*Let whosoever travels to different parts to teach, peruse over mountain, desert, land and sea this supplication.
O God! O God! Thou seest my weakness, lowliness and humility before Thy creatures; nevertheless, I have trusted in Thee and have arisen in the promotion of Thy teachings among Thy strong servants, relying on Thy power and might.
O Lord! I am a broken-winged bird and desire to soar in Thy limitless space.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn11204/">Prayer bpn11204 in English</a></h2>
<p>##Revealed to the Bahá&rsquo;ís of Canada and Greenland Praise be to Thee, O my God! These are Thy servants who are attracted by the fragrances of Thy mercifulness, are enkindled by the fire burning in the tree of Thy singleness, and whose eyes are brightened by beholding the splendors of the light shining in the Sinai of Thy oneness.
O Lord! Loose their tongues to make mention of Thee amongst Thy people, suffer them to speak forth Thy praise through Thy grace and loving-kindness, assist them with the cohorts of Thine angels, strengthen their loins in Thy service, and make them the signs of Thy guidance amongst Thy creatures.</p><hr />
