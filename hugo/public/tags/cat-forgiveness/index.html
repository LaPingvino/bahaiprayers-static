<p>O Thou forgiving Lord! Thou art the shelter of all these Thy servants. Thou knowest the secrets and art aware of all things. We are all helpless, and Thou art the Mighty, the Omnipotent. We are all sinners, and Thou art the Forgiver of sins, the Merciful, the Compassionate. O Lord! Look not at our shortcomings. Deal with us according to Thy grace and bounty. Our shortcomings are many, but the ocean of Thy forgiveness is boundless.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bb00002men/en/">Prayer BB00002MEN in English</a></h2>
<p>Glory be unto Thee, O God. How can I make mention of Thee while Thou art sanctified from the praise of all mankind. Magnified be Thy Name, O God, Thou art the King, the Eternal Truth; Thou knowest what is in the heavens and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return. Thou hast sent down Thy divinely ordained Revelation according to a clear measure. Praised art Thou, O Lord!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bb00485tre/en/">Prayer BB00485TRE in English</a></h2>
<p>I am aware, O Lord, that my trespasses have covered my face with shame in Thy presence, and have burdened my back before Thee, have intervened between me and Thy beauteous countenance, have compassed me from every direction and have hindered me on all sides from gaining access unto the revelations of Thy celestial power. O Lord! If Thou forgivest me not, who is there then to grant pardon, and if Thou hast no mercy upon me who is capable of showing compassion?</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bb00617/en/">Prayer BB00617 in English</a></h2>
<p>I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every mention but the mention of Thee, and for every praise but the praise of Thee, and for every delight but delight in Thy nearness, and for every pleasure but the pleasure of communion with Thee, and for every joy but the joy of Thy love and of Thy good-pleasure, and for all things pertaining unto me which bear no relationship unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of lords, He Who provideth the means and unlocketh the doors.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh00005see/en/">Prayer BH00005SEE in English</a></h2>
<p>Thou seest me, O my Lord, with my face turned towards the heaven of Thy bounty and the ocean of Thy favor, withdrawn from all else beside Thee. I ask of Thee, by the splendors of the Sun of Thy revelation on Sinai, and the effulgences of the Orb of Thy grace which shineth from the horizon of Thy Name, the Ever-Forgiving, to grant me Thy pardon and to have mercy upon me.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh00593/en/">Prayer BH00593 in English</a></h2>
<p>O God our Lord! Protect us through Thy grace from whatsoever may be repugnant unto Thee, and vouchsafe unto us that which well beseemeth Thee. Give us more out of Thy bounty, and bless us. Pardon us for the things we have done, and wash away our sins, and forgive us with Thy gracious forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting. Thy loving providence hath encompassed all created things in the heavens and on the earth, and Thy forgiveness hath surpassed the whole creation.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh00634/en/">Prayer BH00634 in English</a></h2>
<p>Praise be unto Thee, O Lord. Forgive us our sins, have mercy upon us and enable us to return unto Thee. Suffer us not to rely on aught else besides Thee, and vouchsafe unto us, through Thy bounty, that which Thou lovest and desirest and well beseemeth Thee. Exalt the station of them that have truly believed, and forgive them with Thy gracious forgiveness. Verily, Thou art the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh05768/en/">Prayer BH05768 in English</a></h2>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! Every time I venture to make mention of Thee, I am held back by my mighty sins and grievous trespasses against Thee, and find myself wholly deprived of Thy grace, and utterly powerless to celebrate Thy praise. My great confidence in Thy bounty, however, reviveth my hope in Thee, and my certitude that Thou wilt bountifully deal with me emboldeneth me to extol Thee, and to ask of Thee the things Thou dost possess.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh07106/en/">Prayer BH07106 in English</a></h2>
<p>Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Chosen Ones, and by the Bearers of Thy Trust, and by Him Whom Thou hast ordained to be the Seal of Thy Prophets and of Thy Messengers, to let Thy remembrance be my companion, and Thy love my aim, and Thy face my goal, and Thy name my lamp, and Thy wish my desire, and Thy pleasure my delight.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh08600fac/en/">Prayer BH08600FAC in English</a></h2>
<p>I am he, O my Lord, that hath set his face towards Thee, and fixed his hope on the wonders of Thy grace and the revelations of Thy bounty. I pray Thee that Thou wilt not suffer me to turn away disappointed from the door of Thy mercy, nor abandon me to such of Thy creatures as have repudiated Thy Cause. I am, O my God, Thy servant and the son of Thy servant.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/forgiveness/bh08855/en/">Prayer BH08855 in English</a></h2>
<p>Lauded be Thy name, O my God and the God of all things, my Glory and the Glory of all things, my Desire and the Desire of all things, my Strength and the Strength of all things, my King and the King of all things, my Aim and the Aim of all things, my Mover and the Mover of all things! Suffer me not, I implore Thee, to be kept back from the ocean of Thy tender mercies, nor to be far removed from the shores of nearness to Thee.</p><hr />

<p>O fy Nuw, O f&rsquo;Arglwydd, O fy Meistr! Erfyniaf arnat i faddau i mi am geisio unrhyw bleser ond Dy gariad, neu unrhyw gysur ond Dy agosrwydd, neu unrhyw hyfrydwch ond Dy holl-bleser, neu unrhyw fodolaeth ond cymundeb gyda Thi.

<p>O God, my God! Thy grace hath emboldened me, and Thy justice filled me with terror. Happy is that man whom Thou hast endued with Thy grace and woe to him that receiveth Thy justice.
Lord! I have fled from Thy justice, and have sought Thy grace, have turned from Thy wrath and implored Thy pardon. I beseech Thee, by Thy power, Thy sovereignty, Thy glory and Thy favour to illumine mankind with the light of Thy knowledge, that all things may show Thy handiwork, may unfold the mysteries of Thy power, and may reveal the light of Thy knowledge.</p><hr />
