<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10153/">Prayer bpn10153 in English</a></h2>
<p>Pure and sanctified art Thou, O my God! How can the pen move and the ink flow after the breezes of loving-kindness have ceased, and the signs of bounty have vanished, when the sun of abasement hath risen, and the swords of calamity are drawn, when the heavens of sorrow have been upraised, and the darts of affliction and the lances of vengeance have rained from the clouds of power — in such wise that the signs of joy have departed from all hearts, and the tokens of gladness have been erased from every horizon, the gates of hope have been shut, the mercy of the supernal breeze hath ceased to waft over the rose-garden of faithfulness, and the whirlwind of extinction hath struck the tree of existence.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10154/">Prayer bpn10154 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou Who holdest within Thy grasp the Kingdom of names and the Empire of all things, Thou seest how I have become a stranger from my land on account of my love for Thee. I beg of Thee, by the beauty of Thy countenance, to make my remoteness from home a means whereby Thy servants may be drawn nigh unto the Fountain-head of Thy Cause and the Dayspring of Thy Revelation.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10155/">Prayer bpn10155 in English</a></h2>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Exalted, the Most Glorious!
Glory be to Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of all beings and the Ultimate Aim of all creation! I testify with the tongue of both mine inner and outer being that Thou hast revealed and manifested Thyself, that Thou hast sent down Thy verses and demonstrated Thy proofs, and that Thou art independent of anyone besides Thee and sanctified above all else except Thyself.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10156/">Prayer bpn10156 in English</a></h2>
<p>In the Name of our Lord, the Most Holy, the Most Great, the Exalted, the Most Glorious!
O God, my God! Thou seest how Thy servant hath set his face towards Thee and desired to be honoured by performing that whereunto he hath been bidden in Thy Book. Do Thou ordain for him through Thy Most Exalted Pen that which shall draw him nigh unto the Most Sublime Summit. Thou, verily, art the Educator of the world and the Lord of the nations, and Thou, verily, art the Potent, the All-Subduing, the Almighty.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10157/">Prayer bpn10157 in English</a></h2>
<p>O God, my God! Glory be to Thee for having guided me unto the horizon of Thy Revelation, illumined me with the splendours of the light of Thy grace and mercy, caused me to speak forth Thy praise, and given me to behold that which hath been revealed by Thy Pen.
I beseech Thee, O Thou the Lord of the kingdom of names and Fashioner of earth and heaven, by the rustling of the Divine Lote-Tree and by Thy most sweet utterance which hath enraptured the realities of all created things, to raise me up in Thy Name amidst Thy servants.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10158/">Prayer bpn10158 in English</a></h2>
<p>Praise be to Thee, O Lord my God, for guiding me unto the horizon of Thy Revelation and for causing me to be mentioned by Thy Name. I beseech Thee, by the spreading rays of the Daystar of Thy providence and by the billowing waves of the Ocean of Thy mercy, to grant that my speech may bear a trace of the influence of Thine own exalted Word, attracting thereby the realities of all created things.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10159/">Prayer bpn10159 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is the Peerless!
Praise be unto Thee, O Lord my God! I beseech Thee by Thy Most Exalted Name in the Tabernacle of effulgent splendour, and by Thy Most Sublime Word in the Dominion of transcendent glory, to protect this servant, who hath enjoyed companionship with Thee, hearkened unto the accents of Thy voice and recognized Thy proof. Vouchsafe, then, unto him the good of both this world and the next, and grant unto him the station of righteousness in Thy presence, that his feet may not slip from Thine all-glorious and most exalted path.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10160/">Prayer bpn10160 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is the All-Glorious!
Praise be to Thee, O my God! Thou didst call me, and I answered Thee. Thou didst summon me, and I hastened unto Thee, entering beneath the shade of Thy mercy and seeking shelter at the threshold of the door of Thy grace. Thou hast nurtured me, O Lord, through Thy providence, chosen me for Thee alone, created me for Thy service, and appointed me to stand before Thee.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10161/">Prayer bpn10161 in English</a></h2>
<p>O my God! O my God! I testify that this is Thy Day which hath been mentioned in Thy Books, Thy Epistles, Thy Psalms and Thy Tablets. In it Thou hast manifested that which was hidden in Thy Knowledge and stored up in the repositories of Thine unfailing protection. I beseech Thee, O Lord of the world, by Thy Most Great Name whereby the limbs of the people were shaken, to assist Thy servants and Thy handmaidens to become steadfast in Thy Cause and to arise in Thy service.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10162/">Prayer bpn10162 in English</a></h2>
<p>In regard to his affairs, let him repeat nineteen times: “Thou seest me, O my God, detached from all save Thee and cleaving unto Thee. Guide me, then, in all mine affairs unto that which profiteth me for the glory of Thy Cause and the loftiness of the station of Thy loved ones.” Let him then reflect upon the matter and undertake whatever cometh to mind. This vehement opposition of the enemies will indeed give way to supreme prosperity.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10163/">Prayer bpn10163 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of might and grandeur!
O God, my God! I yield Thee thanks at all times and render Thee praise under all conditions. In prosperity, all praise is Thine, O Lord of the Worlds, and in its absence, all gratitude is Thine, O Desire of them that have recognized Thee!
In adversity, all honour is Thine, O Adored One of all who are in heaven and on earth, and in affliction, all glory is Thine, O Enchanter of the hearts of those who yearn after Thee!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn10164/">Prayer bpn10164 in English</a></h2>
<p>Praised be Thou, O Lord my God! Sanctify mine eye, and mine ear, and my tongue, and my spirit, and my heart, and my soul, and my body, and mine entire being from turning unto anyone but Thee. Give me then to drink from the cup that brimmeth with the sealed wine of Thy glory.

<p>O God! Grant Thy favour, and bestow Thy blessing. Vouchsafe Thy grace, and give a portion of Thy bounty. Enable these men to witness during this year the fulfilment of their hopes.
Send down Thy heavenly rain, and provide Thy plenteousness and abundance. Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty.

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12582/">Prayer bpn12582 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou unseen Friend! O Desire of all in this world and the world to come! O Thou compassionate Beloved! These helpless souls are captivated by Thy love, and these feeble ones seek shelter at Thy Threshold. Every night they sigh and moan in their remoteness from Thee, and every morn they lament and weep by reason of the onslaught of the people of malice. They are afflicted at every moment with a fresh anguish, and are sore tried at each breath by the tyranny of every wicked oppressor.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12583/">Prayer bpn12583 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou peerless and loving Lord! Though capacity and worthiness are lacking, and it is infinitely hard to withstand tribulations, yet worthiness and capacity are gifts vouchsafed by Thee. O Lord! Give us capacity and make us worthy, that we may evince the most great steadfastness, renounce this world and all its people, kindle the fire of Thy love, and even as candles, burn bright with a consuming flame and shed abroad our radiance.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12584/">Prayer bpn12584 in English</a></h2>
<p>O my eternal Beloved and my adored Friend! How long shall I remain bereft of Thy presence and sorely afflicted by remoteness from Thee? To the retreats of Thy heavenly Kingdom lead me, and at the scene of the appearance of Thy supernal Realm cast upon me the glance of Thy loving-kindness.
O Thou Omnipotent Lord! Number me among the denizens of the Kingdom. This mortal world is my abode; grant me a habitation in the realms of the Placeless.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12585/">Prayer bpn12585 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou kind Lord! These souls are Thy friends who are gathered together and are carried away by Thy love. They are transported by the rays of Thy beauty and captivated by Thy musk-laden locks. They have surrendered their hearts to Thee and, lowly and helpless, wander in Thy path. They have forsaken friend and stranger alike and have laid hold of Thy unity, bowing in adoration before Thee.
They belonged to this nether world; Thou didst welcome them into Thy Kingdom.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12586/">Prayer bpn12586 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Divine Providence! Perplexing difficulties have arisen and formidable obstacles have appeared. O Lord! Remove these difficulties and show forth the evidences of Thy might and power. Ease these hardships and smooth our way along this arduous path. O Divine Providence! The obstacles are unyielding, and our toil and hardship are conjoined with a myriad adversities. There is no helper save Thee, and no succourer except Thyself. We set all our hopes on Thee, and commit all our affairs unto Thy care.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12587/">Prayer bpn12587 in English</a></h2>
<p>O God of Mercy! O Thou Omnipotent One! I am but a feeble servant, weak and helpless, but I have been nurtured within the shelter of Thy grace and favour, nourished from the breast of Thy mercy, and reared in the bosom of Thy loving-kindness. O Lord! Poor and needy though I be, yet every needy one is made prosperous through Thy bounty, while every wealthy one, if bereft of Thy favours, is indeed poor and desolate.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12588/">Prayer bpn12588 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Divine Providence! Awaken me and make me conscious. Cause me to be detached from all else save Thee, and captivate me by the love of Thy beauty. Waft upon me the breath of the Holy Spirit, and suffer me to hearken to the call of the Abhá Kingdom. Bestow upon me heavenly power, and kindle the lamp of the spirit within the innermost chamber of my heart. Release me from every bond, and deliver me from every attachment, that I may cherish no desire except Thy good-pleasure, seek naught besides Thy Countenance, and tread no path other than Thy path.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12589/">Prayer bpn12589 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God.
O God, my God! I have set my face towards Thee, and supplicate the outpourings of the ocean of Thy healing. Graciously assist me, O Lord, to serve Thy people and to heal Thy servants. If Thou dost aid me, the remedy I offer will become a healing medicine for every ailment, a draught of life-giving waters for every burning thirst, and a soothing balm for every yearning heart.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12590/">Prayer bpn12590 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Lord! Grant me a measure of Thy grace and loving-kindness, Thy care and protection, Thy shelter and bounty, that the end of my days may be distinguished above their beginning, and the close of my life may open the portals to Thy manifold blessings. May Thy loving-kindness and bounty descend upon me at every moment, and Thy forgiveness and mercy be vouchsafed with every breath, until, beneath the sheltering shadow of Thine upraised Standard, I may at last repair to the Kingdom of the All-Praised.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12591/">Prayer bpn12591 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver! A noble soul hath ascended unto the Kingdom of reality, and hastened from the mortal world of dust to the realm of everlasting glory. Exalt the station of this recently arrived guest, and attire this long-standing servant with a new and wondrous robe.
O Thou Peerless Lord! Grant Thy forgiveness and tender care so that this soul may be admitted into the retreats of Thy mysteries and may become an intimate companion in the assemblage of splendours.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12592/">Prayer bpn12592 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God.
O Thou forgiving Lord! These servants were noble souls, and these radiant hearts were made illumined and resplendent through the light of Thy guidance. They drank a brimming cup of the wine of Thy love, and gave ear to eternal mysteries by the melodies of Thy knowledge. They bound their hearts to Thee, broke free from the snare of estrangement, and laid hold of Thy unity. Make these precious souls companions of the inmates of Heaven, and admit them into the circle of Thy chosen ones.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12593/">Prayer bpn12593 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Divine Providence! Immerse the father and mother of this servant of Thy Threshold in the ocean of Thy forgiveness, and purge and sanctify them from every sin and transgression. Grant them Thy forgiveness and mercy, and bestow upon them Thy gracious pardon. Thou, verily, art the Pardoner, the Ever-Forgiving, the Bestower of abundant grace. O Thou forgiving Lord! Though we are sinners, yet our hopes are fixed upon Thy promise and assurance.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12594/">Prayer bpn12594 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou kind Lord! Sanctify my heart from all attachment, and gladden my soul with tidings of joy. Free me from attachment to friend and stranger alike, and captivate me with Thy love, that I may become wholly devoted to Thee and be filled with fervid rapture; that I may desire naught but Thee, seek no one except Thyself, tread no other path besides Thine, and commune only with Thee; that I may, even as a nightingale, be spellbound by Thy love and, by day and night, sigh and wail and weep and cry out, “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12595/">Prayer bpn12595 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Lord! What an outpouring of bounty Thou hast vouchsafed, and what a flood of abounding grace Thou has granted! Thou didst make all the hearts to become even as a single heart, and all the souls to be bound together as one soul. Thou didst endow inert bodies with life and feeling, and didst bestow upon lifeless frames the consciousness of the spirit. Through the effulgent rays shed from the Day-Star of the All-Merciful, Thou didst invest these atoms of dust with visible existence, and through the billows of the ocean of oneness, Thou didst enable these evanescent drops to surge and roar.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12596/">Prayer bpn12596 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou Omnipotent Lord! We are all held within the mighty grasp of Thy power. Thou art our Supporter and our Helper. Grant us Thy tender mercy, bestow upon us Thy bounty, open the portals of grace, and cast upon us the glance of Thy favours. Let a vivifying breeze waft over us, and quicken Thou our yearning hearts. Illumine our eyes and make the sanctuary of our hearts the envy of every blossoming bower.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12597/">Prayer bpn12597 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Lord, our God! We are helpless; Thou art the Lord of strength and power. We are wretched; Thou art the Almighty, the All-Glorious. We are poor; Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most Generous. Graciously assist us in our servitude to Thy sacred Threshold, and aid us, through Thy strengthening grace, to worship Thee at the dawning-places of Thy praise. Enable us to diffuse Thy holy fragrances amongst Thy creatures, and strengthen our loins to serve Thee amidst Thy servants, so that we may guide all nations to Thy Most Great Name and lead all peoples to the shores of the glorious ocean of Thy oneness.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12598/">Prayer bpn12598 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God.
O Thou kind and beloved Lord! These friends are exhilarated with the wine of the Covenant and are wanderers in the wilderness of Thy love. Their hearts are consumed by the flames of remoteness from Thee, and they yearn eagerly for the revelation of Thy splendours. From Thine invisible Kingdom, the Realm of the unseen, reveal unto them the effulgent glory of Thy grace, and shed upon them the radiance of Thy bounty.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12599/">Prayer bpn12599 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is the All-Glorious.
O my Lord, my King, my Ruler, and my Sovereign! I call upon Thee with my tongue, my heart, and my soul, saying: Clothe this servant of Thine with the robe of Thy care, the raiment of Thine unfailing help, and the armour of Thy protection. Assist him to make mention of Thee and to extol Thy virtues amidst Thy people, and unloose his tongue to utter Thy glorification and praise in every assemblage held to celebrate Thy unity and sanctity.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12600/">Prayer bpn12600 in English</a></h2>
<p>O my kind Lord, O Thou the desire of my heart and soul! Bestow upon Thy friends Thy loving-kindness, and grant them Thine unfailing mercy. Be Thou a solace to Thine ardent lovers, and a friend, a comforter, and a loving companion to them who yearn for Thee. Their hearts are ablaze with the fire of Thy love, and their souls are consumed with the flame of devotion to Thee. They long, one and all, to hasten unto the altar of love, that they may willingly lay down their lives.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12601/">Prayer bpn12601 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is the All-Glorious, the Most Effulgent.
O Divine Providence, O forgiving Lord! How can I ever befittingly sing Thy praise or sufficiently worship and glorify Thee? Thy description by any tongue is naught but error, and Thy depiction by any pen is an evidence of folly in attempting this formidable task. The tongue is but an instrument composed of elements; voice and speech are naught but accidental attributes. How, then, can I celebrate, with the instrument of an earthly voice, the praise of Him Who hath neither peer nor likeness?</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12602/">Prayer bpn12602 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Divine Providence, Thou art the Ever-Forgiving! O Thou Almighty God, Thou art the Gracious! Let this dearly loved servant of Thine abide beneath the shadow of Thy glory, and grant that this hapless and lowly one may prosper and flourish within the precincts of Thy mercy. Give him to drink from the chalice of Thy nearness, and let him abide under the shade of the Blessed Tree. Confer upon him the honour of attaining Thy presence, and bestow upon him everlasting bliss.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12603/">Prayer bpn12603 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Thou incomparable God! We are Thy humble servants, and Thou art the All-Glorious. We are sinners, and Thou art the Ever-Forgiving. We are captives, poor and lowly, and Thou art our shelter and our aid. We are as tiny ants, and Thou art the Lord of majesty, enthroned in the highest heaven. Protect us, as a token of Thy grace, and withhold not from us Thy care and assistance. O Lord!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12604/">Prayer bpn12604 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God.
O God, my God! With utter lowliness and fervour, humility and devotion, I implore Thee with my tongue and my heart, with my spirit and my soul, and with my mind and my conscience, to grant the most cherished of all desires, destine the most meritorious of all deeds, and ordain all honour and perfection, favour and beauty, prosperity and salvation for this family that hath hastened to Thy sheltering shadow at the break of Thy resplendent morn and sought refuge within Thy safe haven and Thy mighty stronghold.</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12605/">Prayer bpn12605 in English</a></h2>
<p>O Lord so rich in bounty, so replete with grace, Whose knowledge doth mine inmost heart and soul embrace!
At morn, the solace of my soul is none but Thee; The knower of my loss and woe is none but Thee.
The heart that for a moment hath Thy mention known Will seek no friend save longing pain for Thee alone.
Withered be the heart that sigheth not for Thee, And better blind the eye that crieth not for Thee!</p><hr />

<h2 class="list"><a href="../../prayer/unsorted/en/bpn12903/">Prayer bpn12903 in English</a></h2>
<p>He is God.
O thou who circlest in adoration about the Spot round which circle the Concourse on high! Raise thou thy hands in gratitude at the Threshold of the one true God, and say: O Thou the highest aspiration of every ardent lover! O Thou the Guide of every wandering soul! Thou hast favoured this feeble servant with Thine infinite blessings, and led this hapless and lowly one unto the Threshold of Thy oneness.</p><hr />
