*“Bahá’í marriage is union and cordial affection between the two parties.  They must, however, exercise the utmost care and become acquainted with each other's character.  This eternal bond should be made secure by a firm covenant, and the intention should be to foster harmony, fellowship and unity and to attain everlasting life.” —‘Abdu’l-Bahá

The pledge of marriage, the verse to be spoken individually by the bride and the bridegroom in the presence of at least two witnesses acceptable to the Spiritual Assembly is, as stipulated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (The Most Holy Book):

“We will, all, verily, abide by the Will of God.”
