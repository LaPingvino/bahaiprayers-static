O God, my God! I supplicate confirmation and assistance for those who have arisen to serve Thy Cause and to educate the children who have been nurtured at the breast of Thy love. O God! Glorify these children in Thy kingdom and teach them from Thy knowledge. Thou art the Powerful and the Mighty.


*Remembrance of God, 13
