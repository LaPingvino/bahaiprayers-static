O Lord! Make these children excellent plants. Let them grow and develop in the Garden of Thy Covenant, and bestow freshness and beauty through the outpourings of the clouds of the Abhá Kingdom.
O Thou kind Lord! I am a little child, exalt me by admitting me to the Kingdom. I am earthly, make me heavenly; I am of the world below, let me belong to the Realm above; gloomy, suffer me to become radiant; material, make me spiritual, and grant that I may manifest Thine infinite bounties.
Thou art the Powerful, the All-Loving.
