O Thou Provider, O Thou Forgiver!  A noble soul hath ascended unto the Kingdom of reality, and hastened from the mortal world of dust to the realm of everlasting glory.  Exalt the station of this recently arrived guest, and attire this long-standing servant with a new and wondrous robe.

O Thou Peerless Lord!  Grant Thy forgiveness and tender care so that this soul may be admitted into the retreats of Thy mysteries and may become an intimate companion in the assemblage of splendours.  Thou art the Giver, the Bestower, the Ever-Loving.  Thou art the Pardoner, the Tender, the Most Powerful.
