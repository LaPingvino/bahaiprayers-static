O Lord, our God!  We are helpless; Thou art the Lord of strength and power.  We are wretched; Thou art the Almighty, the All-Glorious.  We are poor; Thou art the All-Possessing, the Most Generous.  Graciously assist us in our servitude to Thy sacred Threshold, and aid us, through Thy strengthening grace, to worship Thee at the dawning-places of Thy praise.  Enable us to diffuse Thy holy fragrances amongst Thy creatures, and strengthen our loins to serve Thee amidst Thy servants, so that we may guide all nations to Thy Most Great Name and lead all peoples to the shores of the glorious ocean of Thy oneness.

O Lord!  Deliver us from the attachments of the world and its peoples, from the transgressions of the past, and from the afflictions yet to come, that we may arise to exalt Thy Word with the utmost joy and radiance and celebrate Thy praise in the daytime and in the night season, that we may summon all people to the way of guidance and enjoin them to observe righteousness, and that we may chant the verses of Thy unity amidst all Thy creation.  Potent art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  Thou art, verily, the Almighty, the Most Powerful.
