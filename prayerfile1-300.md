O God and the God of all Names, and the Maker of the heavens!  I entreat Thee by Thy Name through which He Who is the Dayspring of Thy might and the Dawning-Place of Thy power hath been manifested, through which every solid thing hath been made to flow, and every dead corpse hath been quickened, and every moving spirit confirmed—I entreat Thee to enable me to rid myself of all attachment to any one but Thee, and to serve Thy Cause, and to wish what Thou didst wish through the power of Thy sovereignty, and to perform what is the good pleasure of Thy will.
I beseech Thee, moreover, O my God, to ordain for me what will make me rich enough to dispense with any one save Thee.  Thou seest me, O my God, with my face turned towards Thee, and my hands clinging to the cord of Thy grace.  Send down upon me Thy mercy, and write down for me what Thou hast written down for Thy chosen ones.  Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee.  No God is there but Thee, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bountiful.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
