Magnified art Thou, O Lord of the entire creation, the One unto Whom all things must turn.  With my inner and outer tongues I bear witness that thou hast manifested and revealed Thyself, sent down Thy signs, and proclaimed Thy testimonies.  I testify to Thy self-sufficiency from aught else except Thee, and Thy sanctity above all earthly things.  I entreat Thee by the transcendent glory of Thy Cause and the supreme potency of Thy Word to grant confirmation unto him who desireth to offer what Thou hast prescribed unto him in Thy Book and to observe that which will shed forth the fragrance of Thine acceptance.  Verily Thou art the All-Mighty, the All-Gracious, the All-Forgiving, the All-Generous.

-- Bahá'u'lláh
