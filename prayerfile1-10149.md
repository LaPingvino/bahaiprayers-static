O ye two tender plants in the Abhá Paradise!
Render thanks unto God that ye have sprouted in this heavenly garden. God willing ye will become firmly rooted, will develop and grow through the outpourings of the heavenly clouds and will attain perfection and bring forth fruit through the radiance of the Sun of Reality. Avail ye yourselves of the opportunity of these days and appreciate the value of this glorious century. Strive ye earnestly to become fruitful trees, brilliant lamps and as two stars shining above the horizons of East and West.
And upon ye be the glory of the Most Glorious.

-- Abdu'l-Bahá
