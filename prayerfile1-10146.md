O thou tender plant in the garden of the love of God!
The heavenly gifts of the Ancient Beauty make every plant verdant and fresh, and through the radiance of His everlasting Kingdom every darkness turneth into veritable light. Therefore thou, who art a sapling in the orchard of divine bounty and a smiling blossom of His rose-garden, shouldst become so verdant and flourishing through the outpourings of His grace as to make us all delighted at thy tender beauty.
